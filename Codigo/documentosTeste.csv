NICKEL PRICES UNLIKELY TO RISE MUCH - SHEARSON    LONDON, April 8 - Nickel prices are unlikely to risesignificantly from current levels unless further steps aretaken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said inits quarterly nickel market report.    The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lbyesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January,due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, butShearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year'sbuoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.    Output reductions by producers will take effect later thisyear but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.    Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually inbalance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports fromSocialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).    It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from afirst quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in thelast quarter. The year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lbcompared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchangecash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.;nickel

"CANADIAN PACIFIC (CP) UNIT STUDIES PULP MILL     MONTREAL, Oct 20 - CIP Inc, wholly-owned by CanadianPacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas whichwould use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president CecilSlenniken said in an interview.     The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and wasartificially developed several years ago. The plant, which hasbeen grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet inthree months and is said to produce better quality newsprintthan wood pulp, a CIP official said.     Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre butwould need partners to begin the project.

"U.S. TRADE BILL VERY DANGEROUS FOR CANADA, LOBBY    TORONTO, June 1 -  A trade bill before the United StatesHouse of Representatives ""is a very dangerous bill for Canadianindustry,"" Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman AdamZimmerman told reporters.    By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3removes protection for companies that take advantage of widelyused government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.    ""Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grantrights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could bevulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,"" hesaid.    The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the Houseof Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuringsubsidies that would greatly increase the size of anycountervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadianresource exports to the U.S.    Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices andU.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, hesaid. Such a method would make Canadian resource industriesvulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export taximposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumberto the U.S., Zimmerman added.    Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S.forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervailduty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.    ""We represent the first victim of the move to price othercountries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,""Zimmerman said.    ""If we're an example, than other resource industries hadbetter watch out,"" he added.    Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plansto discuss concerns about the U.S. trade bill with lobby groupsfrom other Canadian resource industries.";lumber
"INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>    JAKARTA, April 8 - The Indonesian Commodity Exchange islikely to start trading in at least one new commodity, andpossibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman PaianNainggolan said.    He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading inpalm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.    Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oilmay also be introduced. But he said the question was stillbeing considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and nodecision on when to go ahead had been made.    The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubberphysicals on an open outcry system four days a week.    ""Several factors make us move cautiously,"" Nainggolan said.""We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make amistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.""    Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffeeadded in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up tofive months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five aretraded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,exchange officials said.    The trade ministry and exchange board are considering theintroduction of futures trading later for rubber, but oneofficial said a feasibility study was needed first. Nodecisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April23, traders said.    Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as theworld's second largest producer of natural rubber, shouldexpand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development ofthe exchange would help this.    Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boostoverseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.    He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan toencourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation wouldalso visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states toencourage participation.    Officials say the infant exchange has made a good startalthough trading in coffee has been disappointing.    Transactions in rubber between the start of trading inApril 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber deliveredlocally, the latest exchange report said.

"US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - A proposal to require importedtropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrowand possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopesthe plan would be adopted this year.    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as anamendment to a farm spending reduction package.    ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as givingAmerican consumers the information they need,"" he said.    Proponents of the measure, including the American SoybeanAssociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oilsare high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicatingtropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourageconsumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,Indonesia and the Philippines.    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible todefend under international trade law and would harm relationswith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of theirsaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relativelylittle from tropical oils.

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT    WASHINGTON, April 9 - Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasonsfor the decline are expected reduced government support priceand good summer crop harvests.;oilseed

JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT    TOKYO, June 18 - Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pctfrom 2.1 pct.;oilseed

"U.S. DRAFTS SANCTIONS IN ARGENTINA SOY CASE    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - The U.S. is drafting options includingpossible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute overthe differential between soybean and product  taxes whichBuenos Aires levies on exports.    The drafting of retaliation options follows the failureof high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filedby the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differentialexport taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports incompetition with the U.S.    ""Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict(Argentine) access to our market,"" said one U.S. source.       The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year afterTrade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed toend the differential.

ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsoredOutlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takesdrastic and immediate steps.""    ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,since they were established after the zero soybean duty wasestablished in 1962,"" he said.    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would askfor an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies tomake the regime non-discriminatory.    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, inan effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds productionhas risen dramatically since then.    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above worldmarket levels and is considering implementing a controversialoils and fats tax.    The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zeroduty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adamssaid.    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support itstrade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes anEC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in theEC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct involume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result ofEC policies, Adams added.

BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS    SAO PAULO, April 8 - Storage problems with Brazil's recordgrain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mlntonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of thisyear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable inharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storageproblems.    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,theoretically sufficient for the crop.    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badlydistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity.    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said.    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crophas been evident from television reports, which have shownenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.;oilseed

"SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY    CHICAGO, June 2 - Nearby months in soybean and soymealfutures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply oflivestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep thenew crop outlook bearish, traders said.    ""A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worriedabout where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,""one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers forthe few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with aDecatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bidanother two cents today to 10 over July futures.    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willingto sell, dealers said.    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the beliefthat even if futures rally back to last month's highs, countrymovement may remain light because farmers in many areas aresold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern halfof the Midwest.    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtimefor maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducingthe weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping thespot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help Julysoybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal hasalready moved to a premium over the August through Octobermonths and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may alsomove to a July premium later this month, they added.";oilseed
FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years.;oilseed

MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET    KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 - Malaysia is unlikely to meet itstargeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.    Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliserand overstressed palms, they said.    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil Worldnewsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely todrop sharply this year.    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell morepalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage theindustry, a leading grower told Reuters.    The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnesagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said.    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this yeardue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expectedto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oiloutput peaks.    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new treesagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reductionwill not be felt for about another three years.;oilseed
"JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 8 - Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market,"" he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the officialsaid.";oilseed

USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT     WASHINGTON, April 9 - U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mlntonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the priorweek, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, thedepartment said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largestbuyers.    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season andnet reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season werefour-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and thefour-week average, it said.    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination withpurchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.    Other significant purchasers for the current year wereMexico and Honduras, it said.    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below theprior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the majorpurchasers, the department said.    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-weekaverage. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, theNetherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset byreductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, theDepartment said.

"US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - A proposal to require importedtropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrowand possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopesthe plan would be adopted this year.    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as anamendment to a farm spending reduction package.    ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as givingAmerican consumers the information they need,"" he said.    Proponents of the measure, including the American SoybeanAssociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oilsare high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicatingtropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourageconsumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,Indonesia and the Philippines.    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible todefend under international trade law and would harm relationswith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of theirsaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relativelylittle from tropical oils.    The committee voted largely along party lines, with threeDemocrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.";oilseed
OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION    HAMBURG, Oct 20 - Oilmeal demand remained strong in theUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seenin the same months last year, with most of the rise coming insoymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose toa record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pcton the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal atseven pct, it said.    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago monthsfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediatelybut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, itestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes byOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year.

"RAINS HELP U.S. WESTERN CORN BELT, MORE SEEN    CHICAGO, June 29 - Weekend rain over the Western Corn Beltbrought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlierthis month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcomemoisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-WeatherInc.    ""There is going to be more rain for the next two, threedays,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal toabove normal moisture this week.""    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southernMinnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in easternNebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend butwere receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio withthudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.    ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, apretty good rain,"" Mohler said.    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparkingan early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board ofTrade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.    Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt isexpected to move over the central Midwest, then move northlater in the week. That could bring new rain patterns acrossthe Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions asearly-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stagein early July, he said.";oilseed
"INDIAN RESERVE BANK TIGHTENS CREDIT POLICY    BOMBAY, Oct 19 - The Reserve Bank of India said it wastightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raisingtheir cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective fromOctober 24.    The move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank'spolicy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March andis aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity.    The central bank also put selective controls on bankadvances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades.    ""The policy's main objective is to fully meet the creditrequirements of agriculture, industry and exports, whilepreventing excessive monetary expansion,"" bank Governor R.N.Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks.    Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be keptunder control in the second half of the current financial year.    Bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first sixmonths of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the sameperiod last year, according to the bank.    Bankers said the bank's move to raise the cash reserveratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupeesfrom the banking system. Banks' total deposits are estimated ataround 1,000 billion rupees.    They said banks are under pressure because of low returnson commercial lending and investments in government securities.    ""Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintaintheir statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and areresorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings,"" said one banker.";oilseed

JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT    TOKYO, June 18 - Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pctfrom 2.1 pct.;rapeseed

ALBERTA SEEDING VIRTUALLY COMPLETE    CALGARY, June 2 - Ninety-six pct of Alberta andnortheastern British Columbia crops have been seeded, about aweek ahead of the 10 year average, according to the Albertawheat pool report.    Hard red spring wheat accounts for most acreage with 6.0mln estimated for this year, little changed from last year.Oats acreage of 1.95 mln is unchanged on last year and barleyarea of 5.9 mln is also similar to last year. Rapeseed plantingof an estimated 3.24 mln is expected five pct up on 1986. Thesouth and south central areas of Alberta lacked moisture withgermination patchy at best. Growth prospects in northern areasare generally in the good to very good range.   Soil moisture is better in the north central and Peaceareas, the wheat pool said.;rapeseed
OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION    HAMBURG, Oct 20 - Oilmeal demand remained strong in theUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seenin the same months last year, with most of the rise coming insoymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose toa record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pcton the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal atseven pct, it said.    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago monthsfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediatelybut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, itestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes byOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposalswere reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mlnat that time last year.;rapeseed

FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years.;sorghum

"INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88    NEW DELHI, April 9 - India's national foodgrain target hasbeen fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchangedfrom the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in itsannual report for 1986/87.    Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterologicalsub-divisions of the country.    The report gave the targets for various crops withestimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grainsincluding sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it waspossible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifyinggrowing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along withgreater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement infertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, addingtotal foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4mln.   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnesof foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-yeardevelopment plan ending March 31, 1990.    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gapof 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining threeyears of the plan by increasing grain output annually by morethan nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only withgood weather, the report said.    ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread ofimproved technology including timely use of inputs (farmmaterials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to bevigrously pursued,"" it said.";sorghum

THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER    BANGKOK, April 8 - Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion ayear ago, the Business Economics Department said.    It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion bahtfrom 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate thisyear resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materialsand semi-finished products.    The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in thefirst quarter due to lower oil prices.    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6billion baht from 56.6 billion.    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lowerearnings from many key commodities including rice whoseearnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26pct and canned pineapples seven pct.    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.;rice

"LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune</AUTHOR>    Tokyo, April 17 - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngopens talks with Japanese government officials today well awarehis demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrusmarkets is likely to be rejected.     But in an interview with Reuters during the flight toTokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw aninternational spotlight on Japan's agricultural importprotection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to openits markets.    ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, butthey are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said.    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessionsduring Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessionswould be unveiled later this month, they said.    ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (PrimeMinister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when hevisits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports bypartially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last weekrequesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial usessuch as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, sayingTokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota forbeef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers wouldlike to buy much more beef than currently allowed.    He cited the example of a California company whichtransports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter tocircumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher thanthe value of the animal, he said.    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry PromotionCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrowfrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japanhas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan toeliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice byApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventuallybe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges becauseliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanesemandarin orange industry.    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate becauseimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. AndJapanese officials have said.   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buysurplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks inGeneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certainminor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.";rice

"INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS    JAKARTA, June 18 - Indonesia rejected World Bankrecommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, asthe country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak.""    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of ""over-production and price interventionin the developed nations.""";rice

AGENCY HEAD SAYS JAPAN SHOULD CUT RICE PRICE    TOKYO, June 19 - The government should cut its consumerrice price if the official producer price is reduced nextmonth, Tetsuo Kondo, director general of the government'sEconomic Planning Agency (EPA), told reporters.    Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers shouldreceive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming dueto the strong yen and lower oil prices.

The consumer rice price is usually set in December.;rice

"INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM IDEAS    JAKARTA, June 18 - Indonesia rejected World Bankrecommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, asthe country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak.""    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of ""over-production and price interventionin the developed nations.""";rice
"PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS    ISLAMABAD, June 29 - Pakistani government allowed freercotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimedat narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech the government had also decided to allowduty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industrymore competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export ofPakistani products.       Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s.    But Haq said now the private sector would also exportcotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets along-standing demand of the local traders.    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed tobring down prices and help the local ancillary industriescompete effectively in the world market, he said.       Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years butreviewed every year.    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcingtrade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it wouldenable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over alonger period.    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been providedfor the export of engineering goods to selected third worldcountries on soft credit terms.       Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 percent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.    He said the government policy was to rationalise andstreamline import controls.    ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, localindustry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" hesaid. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goodsproduced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave riseto smuggling and hampering of exports.""       He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freedfrom import restrictions.    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely fromremittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in theGulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after thedrop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of abalance of payments crisis for Pakistan.";rice
"JAPAN MINISTRY HAS NO COMMENT ON RICE TALKS REPORT    TOKYO, April 9 - The Agriculture Ministry declined commenton a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talkson its closed rice market in the new GATT round.    ""We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,"" aspokesman told Reuters.    Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngand U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of itsintentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month forfarm talks.    The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issueat the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Tradetalks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.    Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the FoodstuffControl Act.    Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries aboutmounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japanwill try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy isjustified, it said.

"JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 8 - Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market,"" he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the officialsaid.";rice
"GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT    ACCRA, June 19 - Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maizeimports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.    Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchweymade the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnesof rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aidprogramme.    The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, followsgovernment concern over ""lower than average rainfall in southernGhana and its implications for the major harvest.""    Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growingareas throughout the south this year. The Ministry ofAgriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in allmajor staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequencesof current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the droughtexperiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps toalleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.    The failure of seasonal rains has already seriouslyaffected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in partsof the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers havedried up.";rice

"INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88    NEW DELHI, April 9 - India's national foodgrain target hasbeen fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchangedfrom the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in itsannual report for 1986/87.    Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterologicalsub-divisions of the country.    The report gave the targets for various crops withestimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grainsincluding sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it waspossible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifyinggrowing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along withgreater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement infertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, addingtotal foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4mln.   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnesof foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-yeardevelopment plan ending March 31, 1990.    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gapof 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining threeyears of the plan by increasing grain output annually by morethan nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only withgood weather, the report said.    ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread ofimproved technology including timely use of inputs (farmmaterials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to bevigrously pursued,"" it said.";rice

PAKISTAN ALLOWS PRIVATE COTTON, RICE EXPORTS    ISLAMABAD, June 29 - The Pakistani government allowed theprivate sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policyannounced to cover the next three years.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free importof cotton yarn.    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton andrice along with the state corporations.    He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to makehigh quality yarn available to local ancillary industries andto enable them to compete effectively in the world market. Thiswould help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.;rice
BOMB THREATS, STRIKES AS FIJI SEES END TRADE BAN    SUVA, June 2 - Fiji today welcomed the ending of a tradeban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of thecountry's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressurefor his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.    The government welcomed a decision by the AustralianWaterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments toFiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-electedgovernment was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.    The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the uniondecision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of riceand wheat from an Australian port, the government said.    Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugarindustry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.    In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of theAustralian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to bea hoax.

DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS    MANILA, April 11 - A prolonged dry spell has damaged111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provincesin the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officialssaid.    They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produceestimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack ofrainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailingconditions continued until next month.    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped thelosses would be offset by the expected increase in output inother, normally more productive areas not affected by the dryspell.    Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.    About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.    Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has beenhit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national totalthus the damage is considered negligible.    In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled byproduction from non-traditional corn farms which diversifiedinto the cash crop from sugar two years ago.     The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut productionin the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were noreports of actual damage.;rice

The three locals represent about 2,600 production andmaintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about600 office and technical workers.    The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since thestrike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare forcemajeure, which means the company may be unable to honorcontracts for products from the smelter and mine.    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons oflead last year.

FINNS AND CANADIANS TO STUDY MTBE PRODUCTION PLANT    HELSINKI, April 8 - Finland's national oil company Neste Oy<NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firmsto study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.    The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mlnCanadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether(MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.    The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese CanadaInc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe LineCompany Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.    The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materialsavailability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and theimportant capital and operating advantages gained by locatingon an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.    The partners would look into the feasibility of a plantproducing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancerthat can replace tetra ethyl lead.    Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United Stateswhere lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because ofhealth concerns, the statement added.    Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as theU.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination inCanada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,it said.    Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over fivebillion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has amajor investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.    The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go onstream in late 1989, the statement said.;lead

LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS<AUTHOR>    By Donald Bradshaw, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, April 9 - Lead prices have risen this week againsta background of a finely balanced physical sector, traderssaid.    Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buyingor if labour problems develop in North America, they added.    London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant ata time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening andprices tending to drift lower.    This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the lowlevel of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physicaldemand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.    The supply problems are not new but are beginning to befelt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traderssaid.    The lower supply levels result from a number of differentfactors around the globe.    Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countriesbecause of production and transport problems, lack of Spanishexports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter atLinares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meantadditional demand being directed to merchants who in turn havebeen drawing on LME stocks.    In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeksfor maintenance. Although the company said it would meetcommitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.    And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnesper year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocksand contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within theU.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production anda regular supplier to the world market.    Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.    On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held upquite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reportedin the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in thefirst two months of the year, was resumed when a large buyingorder was filled by merchants in March.    Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead pricesthis week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg andestablish a premium of around 10 stg over three monthsdelivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal inGothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is oftena target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.    On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerpand Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,and this is believed to be in strong hands.    Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowestlevel since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouseswhich are not popular with merchants putting togethershipments.    But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes sincethe start of the year. Traders said this is partly due tosecondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed suppliesaffected by environmental controls, which put restrictions onthe transport of used batteries.

VESSEL LOST IN PACIFIC WAS CARRYING LEAD    LONDON, June 18 - The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrierCumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, wascarrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.    He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.    Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange saidthe vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New SouthWales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morningtrading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamentalnews due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and lowstocks.    Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentratescould convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although thisdepended on the quality of the concentrates.    A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supplypipeline, particularly in North America, they noted.

COMINCO <CLT.TO> SEES MEETING WITH STRIKING UNION LOCALS    TRAIL, British Columbia, June 1 - Cominco Ltd said itexpects to meet today with two of five United Steelworkers ofAmerica locals on strike at its Trail smelter and Kimberley,B.C. lead-zinc mine, a Cominco spokesman said.    It had no meeting scheduled with the other three strikinglocals, which rejected a tentative three-year contractSaturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.    Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost ofliving increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, butno wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.    The three locals represent about 2,600 production andmaintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about600 office and technical workers.    The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since thestrike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare forcemajeure, which means the company may be unable to honorcontracts for products from the smelter and mine.    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons oflead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 mileseast of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,most for processing at the Trail smelter.

"LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nationsstill comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilizecurrencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at theweekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lowerrange for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank ofJapan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.    ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, andanyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret itlater on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk thedollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, henoted.    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved inmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Wouldnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollaragainst the mark or the yen.    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and141.35 yen.    ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higherinterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but thisdoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic frameworkof the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid anyfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not onlyhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debtproblem.    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise theirinterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond marketsfurther, the monetary officials said.    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declinedto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a furtherdecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationaryexpectations in the U.S.    ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvreagreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry officialsaid.    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday thatWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of WestGermany's increase in short-term interest rates.    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollardecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in theaccord, foreign exchange dealers said.    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additionalstatement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" andthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, thedealers said.    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day inTokyo currency markets.    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguisedpressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rateshigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,or international economic policy coordination.    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other'seconomic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" topersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateralsurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West Germanpolicy so openly,"" the ministry official said.    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policyshould thus be regarded as a process of healthy policycoordination and not as any indication of a possible collapseof the Louvre agreement, the official said.    He also said Japan has not received any specific requestfrom the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-termmoney rates have been edging higher.    ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not takingpolicy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal raterise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" headded.";yen

"U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, April 9  - The United States, which has longsought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to besatisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development andallows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreementto stabilize currencies.    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announcedyesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrialpowers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.    And the initial reaction of currency markets in the FarEast demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced thatcurrencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though thecountries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one pointdespite intervention by the Bank of Japan.    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said themovement since Paris was consistent with currency tradingranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.    ""I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the pastseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in thediscussions in Paris,"" Miyazawa said yesterday.    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs wasannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve ofMiyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday'smeetings of leading industrial nations.    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action""extraordinary and urgent"", the meeting reaffirmed the ParisAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within rangesbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- thereforerepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation tofoster exchange rate stability.    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted centralbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt thedollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale ofintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recentyears. Monetary sources also said they understood thatSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremelysuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.    They also said there was a growing feeling among thefinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation overmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-termdifferences in past meetings.    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything likethe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face ofyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from othercountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues thatmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalancebetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America'strade deficit have already taken place.    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cutthe budget deficit even though it is implied in thereafffirmation of Paris.    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts areessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall thatreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier thisweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A furthersharp fall to redress trade imbalances would ""clearly posesubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and couldundermine confidence in future financial stability,"" he said.    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force thepolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germanywelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its owncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weakdollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, theJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on makingtheir policy coordination more binding and one, CanadianFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summitto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.    The United States and France, backed by the InternationalMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or ""norms"" for alimited number of economic objectives such as growth,inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and currentaccount balances.    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result inconsultations between the countries on whether correctiveaction should be required.    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectiveshas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because itimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfullysounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limitcurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret rangesof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from therelatively free currency markets of recent years.";yen

JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS    TOKYO, June 19 - Japan could avoid a sharp rise in thevalue of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. Andother nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, anadvisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency(EPA) said.    The advisory body said in its report that the yen wouldsoar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a globalbasis were delayed.    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall toslightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed torestructure their economies.    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cutJapan's current account surplus to two pct of gross nationalproduct (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a changewould slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annuallyduring the seven-year period to 1993.    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollarwould remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan'scurrent-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993.

The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the daysjust before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlyingbearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meetingof the finance ministers and central bankers of the top sevenindustrialized nations in Washington.    After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued acommunique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement'sview that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistentwith economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stabilityshould be fostered around these levels.    The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.    ""They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line withfundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in linewhen it's at 146.

Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that thekey psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of theauthorities' permissible range.

"TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN<AUTHOR>    By Rie Sagawa</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watchingnervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below thesignificant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.    ""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it isconsidered to be the lower end of the reference range. If thecurrency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichiKangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Fridaycloses of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New Yorkand 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.    ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearishsentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. Hesaid this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation amongthe group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement theLouvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-daydrop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weaknessin U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but hestrongly criticised West German moves to raise key interestrates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatiencewith some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accorddue to their fears of increasing inflation.    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationarypressures also slow domestic demand.    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings toboost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Tradedeficit, Tanaka said.    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a stillmassive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interestrates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.    ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nationscoordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchangedepartment.

Dealers here will also want tosee how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market andwhat sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.    There is also a view among European traders that, while theproposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide anotheruseful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysiangovernment -- in the past viewed as a major player at times bythe trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.    Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption oftrading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that whilethere has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subjecta definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Courtlitigation actions have been resolved.    Spot tin prices on the European free market are currentlyaround 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouseRotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a tenyear low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as4,680 stg in December 1986.    This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME tradingceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.    LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485tonnes reached in February 1986.    Traders said the free market turned bullish during latelast year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demanddeficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predictingprices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.    However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswingin sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.    The decline accelerated as producers who had sold verylittle metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.    There was also a lack of significant demand from majorsteel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.    Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tinholdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,and the bulk of material still available is being held byMalaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress themarket with unwanted metal.    Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after theInternational Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager haltedsupport operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 membersnations of the International Tin Agreement.    The overhang of metal was reduced further by brokerShearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reportedhaving sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tinposition.    Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tinprices and movements are still expected to be largely relatedto currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demandemerges for the third quarter.    The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has madeefforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher worldprices by attempting to bring all major producers under anexport control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, twomajor producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument andapparently are continuing to offer material at discounts toconsumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.";tin
PARIS GROUP PUBLISHING DAILY FRANC TIN PRICE    PARIS, April 8 - The Association of White Metals hasdecided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.    The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, wasintroduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems forsome French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metalsassociation said.    Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos andTuesday's at 4,790.    The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing atin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tintrading on October 24, 1985.    The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate aFrench franc price over the last few months to ensure it wasreliable, the spokesman said.    The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, aminimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railwaystation and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.

"MALAYSIA TO RESEARCH TIN, WARY ON VEG OILS TAX<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>    BRUSSELS, June 19 - Malaysia is to urge fellow tinproducing countries to contribute more money towards researchinto new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industriesminister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview.    Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said hehad instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executivecommittee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC,to draw up a paper on the matter.    Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner FransAndriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.    He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposalsfor a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would bedefeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.    Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax wasadopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,they would be compensated through access to the EC foralternative exports.    ""Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannotsee how this would work out in our case,"" Lim said.    Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250mln dlrs a year.    The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPCmeeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.    ""Not enough research and development effort has been put inby tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutessuch as aluminium, paper and plastics,"" Lim said.    He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as anexciting possible new application.    Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra moneywhich needed to be spent on research into new uses before thenew paper was produced.    He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamentalbarriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new InternationalRubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accordinto some EC languages are still being awaited.    Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia'sbehalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said itwas important there should not be a long ""interregnum"" betweenthe old agreement lapsing in October and the new one cominginto force.    He described the present accord as a model for commodityagreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing andconsuming countries and by virtue of its review systems andcontrol over buffer stock management.";tin
"ITC CONTESTS USE OF DOCUMENTS AS COURT EVIDENCE    LONDON, June 18 - The International Tin Council, ITC,intervened in a High Court hearing in an attempt to prevent thepresentation of internal Council documents as evidence.    The intervention in Shearson Lehman's action against theLondon Metal Exchange over its ""ring out"" of tin contracts in1986 is likely to have implications for other cases in whichthe Council is involved following the collapse of its bufferstock operations in October 1985, ITC delegates said.    The ITC's case is being presented by Professor RosalynHiggins and is expected to take a further one or two days nextweek. Court does not sit tomorrow.    In essence the Council is claiming that its status issimilar to that of a foreign embassy and that its archives cantherefore not be used in an English court of law.

TIN COUNCIL ALLOWED APPEAL ON USE OF DOCUMENTS    LONDON, Oct 20 - Britain's highest court has decided theInternational Tin Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITCdocuments in court actions.    On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to whatextent ITC documents, whether circulated or not, are admissibleas court evidence. Lawyers working in the legal tangle leftfrom the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said thishearing is likely to last a few days.

THAI SMELTER FACES TIN CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTAGE    BANGKOK, June 19 - Thailand's major tin exporter andproducer <Thailand Smelting and Refining Co> (Thaisarco) saidit may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because ofinsufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines.    Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales toThaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS> unit, to less than20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonneaverage, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters.    He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to letthe temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exportedtin lapse on June 3.    The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct thismonth from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lowerlevels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aidthe tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.    Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet alarge portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100tonnes per day.    As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated bythe Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the yearending February 1988.    Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC toallocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.    The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however,because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a MineralResources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes latethis month, Yoot said.    The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tinduring January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.;tin

"EUROPEAN COFFEE TRADE PROPOSES NEW QUOTA FORMULA<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Lovell, Reuters</AUTHOR>    AMSTERDAM, June 19 - European coffee roasters and tradershave agreed to propose a new formula for calculatingInternational Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, Dutch CoffeeTrade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said.    Van Horick, who is a council member of the European CoffeeFederation, was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting.    The new formula is based on six-year moving averages andwould give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, anunchanged quota for the remaining two years of the currentcoffee agreement, van Horick said.    If accepted by the consumer and producer members of theICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a newagreement, van Horick said.    Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year whenprices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster inBrazil.    Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers andproducers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.    ""Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in theformula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposalleaves it very little to object to,"" van Horick said.    ""The existing quota system is far too rigid and does notreflect supply and demand reality,"" he said. ""Our formulabuilds flexibility into the system and will benefit almosteveryone.""    Although full implications of the new formula have still tobe worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such asColombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightlyhigher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, ElSalvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.    Because the proposal provides that future quotadistribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, itshould also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doingso would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.    ""If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at leasta fair chance of being accepted by the producers at theSeptember meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of anew quota formula, "" van Horick said.    At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.    ""Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. Ifthere is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next twomonths and most other producers favour our proposal, we mightjust get an agreement,"" van Horick added.";coffee
UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES    KAMPALA, April 11 - Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)has stopped offering coffee on the international market becauseit is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.    The board suspended offerings last week but because of itsurgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long itcould sustain, the sources added.    Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have beenwaiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has hadtrouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to theKenyan port of Mombasa.    Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis byholding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings fromcoffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.    The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee moneyand President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penaltyfor such delays, it added.    Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was thatcommercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings-- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in thecurrent coffee year, while the government had asked for 100billion.    The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct ofannual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.    The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's exportearnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows islikely to more than offset an expected increase in production.    CMB officials have forecast that because the government hasrestored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda willproduce over three mln bags of coffee in the year endingSeptember 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.;coffee
UGANDA PLANS TO EXPORT ROASTED COFFEE TO EUROPE    KAMPALA, Oct 19 - Uganda plans to export roasted coffee toEurope by the end of 1988, a prominent local businessman said.    A.R.

Construction will start inDecember and the factory should be ready by next October.

Uganda is the world's fifth largest coffee producer, andexpects to produce about 200,000 tonnes this year.    Market sources say roasted coffee exports will benefitUganda's economy as they will not be included in the 2.38 mln(60 kg) bag export quota assigned to the country under thelatest International Coffee Agreement.    In addition, the value of roasted coffee should besubstantially higher than that of unroasted beans, they said.

"COLOMBIA HELPFUL BUT COFFEE QUOTAS UNCERTAIN--U.S.    WASHINGTON, June 19 - A U.S. government trade officialresponsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord oncoffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombianefforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.    Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative justback from trade talks in Colombia, said most producingcountries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must beagreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.    ""There is one country which evidently still does not,""Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which hasbeen negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.

He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technicaldiscussions with Colombian officials.

"IVORY COAST WEATHER NO PROBLEM FOR 1986/87 CROPS    ABIDJAN, June 29 - Ivory Coast rainfall this season hasbeen less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffeeproduction has not suffered, the official Ivorian dailyFraternite Matin reported.    The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dryconditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant ifthere is good rainfall in coming weeks.    Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowestin northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop hasespecially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matinsaid.

Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oilmay also be introduced. But he said the question was stillbeing considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and nodecision on when to go ahead had been made.

"U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED<AUTHOR>    BY Susan Zeidler</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - A voluntary compliance system formonitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewedskeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts andtrade sources.    ""Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because ofthe past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as itbecame a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" oneanalyst said.    On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter saidthe Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement avoluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation tomonitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.    Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffeeimporters would voluntarily present needed documents to theU.S. government until Congress approves the monitoringauthority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,it will still be allowed entry.    While many believe producers will not seek to add to theoverburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe somewill ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu ofmonitoring controls, trade sources said.    ""Last time, there was a lot of false information submittedto customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" aU.S. Customs spokesman said.    ""Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but whenits hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demandForm O (documents tracking merchandise from source todestination),"" he said.    Many see it as a true test of whether producers andimporters will abide by the quota system.    ""It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in thequota agreement,"" said one major U.S. roaster.     ""Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade didnot act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""withoutthe need to submit documents, the ball will be in theproducers' hands.""    Some feel that importers will take advantage of thevoluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-membercountries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falselylabelled.    According to customs officials, several green coffeeimporters confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffeefraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navybeans.    ""If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices forone country and another, producers may be teted to get rid oftheir stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and bycircumventing the quota provisions,"" said Paine Webber analystBernie Savaiko.    Still, others believe that producers will not be hardpressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation inthe U.S. in the near term.    ""It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would nothave some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary systemseemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have somuch coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of athreat,"" one trader said.";coffee
"RPT - EUROPEAN TRADE MAY PROPOSE NEW ICO FORMULA<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Lovell, Reuters</AUTHOR>    AMSTERDAM, June 17 - European coffee traders and roastersmay propose a new formula for calculating International CoffeeOrganization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meetinghere this week, traders and officials told Reuters.    Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of thepossible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, theworld's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for thenext two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.    ""The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil'sattitude, and this compromise could be a solution, "" one said.    However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,which began here today and is to continue to the end of theweek, has revealed gaps in the European position onre-introducing quotas.    Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was againstre-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally infavour with the single proviso that there had to be someformula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producingcountries.    The roasters said the positions were generally fairlyclose, and problems with some Government officials.    Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarizedGovernment attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.    Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quotare-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.    ""Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by theend of the week to at least present a common European Community(EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of theInternational Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,"" one trader said.    ""We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that notonly the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,""one official said.    ""We have learned that we can live without the quotas thatwere suspended in February last year, but would prefer thestability they can bring to the market as long as we do notsimply return to the old and outdated status quo as far asquota allocation is concerned,"" he added.    Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on thelikelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildlypessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.    ""Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On theconsumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quotare-introduction, "" he said.    ""The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the newBrazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the leastnegotiable position of any of his predecessors,"" one tradersaid.    ""However, with many producers starting to swing in favour ofthe consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated undera new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, whichgives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quotameeting in September,"" the official said.";coffee

"U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan</AUTHOR>    LONDON, Oct 20 - The United States is prepared to ""pull outall the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassadorto GATT Michael Samuels said.    Those rights are now being challenged by the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told aconference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate ifthe EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef withoutthe issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effecton January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meatshipments into the EC.    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseedprices over the current market level and which may be extendedto include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral tradenegotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to beerected,"" Samuels said.    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farmsubsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it isunrealistic.    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposalon farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formallynext week.    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reducetensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cerealssubstitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction offarm subsidies.    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long asthey are directly linked to long-term commitments to end majortrade distortions, Samuels said.    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formallysubmitted and respond to it officially then.    ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Estedeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""the U.S. Ambassador said.    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignoresthe U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.    The key difference between the two approaches is that theU.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushingonly for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,there would be little incentive for the Community to work tocorrect the international trade situation, he added.    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the ECoilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports tothird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which theU.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.";livestock

JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT    TOKYO, June 18 - Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier.

"EC MEAT DIRECTIVE DEADLINE SEEN FLEXIBLE    WASHINGTON, April 13 - U.S. officials said they held outlittle hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw acontroversial meat inspection requirement, due to go intoeffect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cutoff their exports.    But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the yearprovided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.Agriculture Department.    The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive willrequire foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with ECinspection standards beginning April 30.    The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requestingthe Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.    At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mlndlrs in 1985.    The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changesin their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffingto use of wood.    Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approvedwithout further review. USDA would have to certify that theplants had corrected the deficiencies.    All remaining plants with a history or potential ofshipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require moresignificant changes in plant constructions or procedures beforefurther EC review.

"EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - The European Community (EC) agreed atrade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the countryfollowing the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, ECofficials said.    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentinawill gain additional trading rights on a series of productsincluding meat, fish and cereals by-products.    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals withCanada and Japan and are due to study these again, theofficials said.    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of ECstates after West Germany withdrew objections to increasedquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,saying that the main dispute was over sales of cerealssubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, theofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade).    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership.

""Company management is less concerned about the risk tohealth than about raising plant output and company profits,""Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee onLivestock, Dairy and Poultry.    Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the GovernmentAccountability Project, said inspectors consistently discloseviolations of federal law, demonstrating a ""serious breakdown inthe entire inspection system.""    Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring beingcontaminated by ""intestines dragging in a water trough used toflush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blowtheir noses.""    Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defendedthe government's program, calling it ""one of the most respectedpublic health programs in the world.""    FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5billion chicken and turkeys every year.    Houston said inspection programs have kept pace withchange, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues inthe meat and poultry supply has increased.    He also said that, although he was confident the bacteriumsalmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take timeand much money to contain the growing problem.    Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, isfound in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of rawpork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.    The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.    ""We certainly really have not found an effective means ofturning this disease around,"" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)    The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSISintensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures fordetecting microoganisms.    But the meat and poultry industries have said such controlswould cost too much.    ""Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarilycomplicated procedures that may become obstacles to the realgoal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious andeconomical meat supply for consumers,"" Stanley Emerling,executive vice president of the National Association of MeatPurveyors, said.    Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a newprogram allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions atcertain plants ""voids the law in letter and spirit, and must berepealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemicof death and illness for which there will be no prevention norlegal recourse.""

"JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 8 - Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market,"" he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the officialsaid.";livestock

"U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS<AUTHOR>    by Keith Leighty, Reuters</AUTHOR>    CHICAGO, April 9 - Commodities from gold to grains tocotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as lossesin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears ofinflation and economic instability.    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York.    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets.    ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""Ifthey do, it's not evident.""    ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be.    ""One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.    ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening,"" he said.    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick.    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains.    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand.    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher.    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They saidhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals.";livestock

"DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY    HARARE, April 9 - Zimbabwe's beef exports to the EuropeanCommunity (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs thisyear, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouthdisease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.    The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to theEC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the ECveterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.    The outbreak in the country's main ranching province hasalready led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia tobar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairyindustry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in exportrevenue.    ""The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normallywhen an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension ofbeef exports,"" one industry source said yesterday.     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, ""Depending on theseriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee thendecides on three options, allowing us to continue exportingbeef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspensionon exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We arestill awaiting their decision,"" he added, asking not to beidentified.    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes ofhigh-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country hadspent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences andupgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will beforced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at lowprices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef salescould fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.";livestock
MEXICAN CATTLE IMPORTS TO BE BRANDED - USDA    WASHINGTON, April 8 - All steers imported into the UnitedStates from Mexico must now be branded with the letter M on theright jaw, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.

"SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS<AUTHOR>    By Tony Barber</AUTHOR>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - The Soviet Union outlined its economictargets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improvestandards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.    Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Sovietindustrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from aplanned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against aplanned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures theoutput of a country's goods and services.    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes ofgrain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscowproduced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedmachine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization isessential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively onworld markets.    ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987compared with the same period last year.    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase plannedfor the industry for the whole of 1988.    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recentmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended toa large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources,"" he said.    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet thatdefense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the samefigure as was announced last year.    Western governments view official Soviet estimates fordefense spending as highly understated, but say the real figureis hard to calculate because Soviet military industries areintertwined with the civilian economy.

SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - The Soviet Union's industrial output isgrowing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign tradehas fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.    Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda showindustrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.    Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2pct.    Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billionroubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.    One factor affecting industrial growth was the introductionof a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Lastyear's calculations of industrial output included all goods,irrespective of quality.    Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, specialinspectors have the right to reject goods they consider belowstandard.    Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods wererejected in the nine-month period.    The figures also showed that on October 1, there were morethan 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.    The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of theeconomy has been an important part of the modernisationcampaign, with measures introduced recently to allow thesetting up of small shops on a private basis.    Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine monthsagainst 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.    But western economists said they treat Soviet productivityfigures with caution, as they are more broadly based than inthe West, which measures worker output over a given period.    Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Unionas of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same periodlast year.

"HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION<AUTHOR>    By Emma Robson, Reuters</AUTHOR>    AMSTERDAM, April 8 - Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hopedto maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth tothe 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despitecontinuing investments in a reorganization program and effortsto extend world penetration.    Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mlnguilders, after 265 mln in 1985.    Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe'sleading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.    The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.    Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weakerforeign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.    Further consolidation of foreign companies, including theincrease of its stake in leading Spanish brewery <El AguilaS.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularlyin French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. Thecompany still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year inrestructuring and marketing, Heineken said.    Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profitnext year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations hadalready turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.    Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by theEuropean Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beerinto the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beermarket -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. ""Wehave the beer, but distribution and sales is the importantpoint,"" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heinekenhad been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.    ""The question is not if we want to penetrate the Germanmarket, but how we are to do it,"" van Schaik said, adding thatwhile the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing ataste for foreign beer, the internal structure was veryregionalized.     Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible forAfrican operations, said he saw Africa as one of the mostimportant beer growth markets in the long term.     He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and withmajority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, washampered by the lack of hard currencies there.    Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine litersper head per year and sales are limited by import restrictionsand currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total1986 sales.    On-site production is rendered expensive by the high priceof imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientistshave been looking at other possibilities.    To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched onthe Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, whichhad sold successfully, Coebergh said.    Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional rawmaterials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer werepopular in Rwanda . ""This is a possibility, but we could notpossibly achieve the Heineken flavor,"" Coebergh said.    Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts topenetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in acontract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.    But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken'smarket potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow thatare enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept westernmoney.";earn

J.P. MORGAN <JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING    NEW YORK, April 8 - J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said itsfirst-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting itspreviously announced decision to place on non-accrual statusits 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.    That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interestpayments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in thefirst three months of 1986.    Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securitiesunderwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mlndlrs in the year-earlier period.    In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other tradinglosses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading andunderwriting of Euromarket securities.    Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remaineddifficult last quarter, with floating rate notes sufferingheavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whetherMorgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.    On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loanlosses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreignexchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln andtrust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.    Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees andcommissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but netinvestment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.    Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the firstquarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fellto 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.    If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which meansthat interest can be recorded as income only when payments areactually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resumepayments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.    After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance forcredit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs comparedwith 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.    It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs aftercharge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.    Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a yearearlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related topersonnel costs, Morgan said.;earn

"REUTERS CHAIRMAN URGES FREER INFORMATION FLOWS    LONDON, April 8 - Exchanges and telecommunicationsauthorities should abolish their restrictions on full and freedissemination of information to the investment and bankingcommunities, Reuters Holdings Plc <RTRS.L> chairman SirChristopher Hogg said.    In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiationshad brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchangesfor fuller, but still not complete, access to market datathrough Reuter services.    ""Many other markets maintain restrictions,"" he added.    Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe thatinformation restrictions protected their interests.    In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting thedistribution of data in order to provide competitive advantageto their own commercial information businesses.    He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in thetelecommunications field, some countries continue to protecttheir state monopolies at the expense of other economicsectors.    ""Reuter dealing services remain excluded from suchcountries. As a result, banking communities serving entireeconomies are put at a competitive disadvantage,"" he added.

AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS    THE HAGUE, April 9 - Dutch insurer AEGON NV <AEGN.AS>reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mlnguilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profitsfor 1987.    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billionguilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said itsrevenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and achange in accounting practice. It added that revenues wouldhave risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainlydue to its life insurance business.    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rosedespite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums andhigher personal risks.    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damageinsurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health andlife insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a changein accounting for U.S. Annuities.    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personalinvestment influences that it should be accounted differentlyfrom the more traditional insurances.    This change in accounting practice and another change toaccount for profits made on fixed interest investments,resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mlnguilders.    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profitswere slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initialcosts for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in TheHague.    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emergedin the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initialcosts for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON inMay 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by thesecosts and made only a small contribution to the group'sprofits.    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwillfor Monumental Corp.    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December1986, against 3.46 billion the year before. ;earn

MORGAN CRUCIBLE SAYS PROSPECTS ARE ENCOURAGING    LONDON, April 13 - Morgan Crucible Co Plc <MGCR.L> said theprospects for 1987 were encouraging, with orders and salessignificantly up on last year in all divisions.    It said there were good opportunities for growth in bothexisting and recently acquired businesses as well as for growthby acquisition in related areas.    It earlier announced a 6.1 mln stg rise in pre-tax profitto 24.8 mln stg for the year to December 28. Turnover rose to242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.    Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown inthe U.S., U.K. And Australian economies in the first half.    Currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around onemln stg, it noted.    Morgan said although profits in the electronics sectorimproved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, resultswere nonetheless disappointing.    Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayeddefence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had takenthe necessary remedial action, obtained new business and wasnow proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.

"WALL STREET STOCKS/BROWNING FERRIS <BFI>    NEW YORK, April 13 - The Environmental Protection Agency'sfive to 10 mln dlr suit against a Browning-Ferris IndustriesInc <BFI> unit, CECOS International Inc, caused the stock todrop today, analysts said.    The stock has fallen 2-1/4 to 56-1/8 so far today, afterthe news about the suit was released this morning.    ""It's potentially a big suit and investors feel that itsnot good to go against regulators,"" Kenneth Ch'u-K'ai Leung, aSmith Barney analyst said.    ""What investors are actually saying by selling off some BFIshares is the cloud over this industry is the threat that theEPA will get tough on waste management companies,"" WillardBrown, senior analyst for First Albany Corp.    ""Investors are saying to themselves that waste managementcompanies have that kind of exposure to regulatory suits,""Brown said. Brown said if the suit were settled for 10 mln dlrsit would have an impact on Browning Ferris earnings.    Leung said, however, that Browning-Ferris has adequate cashreserves to cover the fine.

"VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES    WOLFSBURG, West Germany, April 9 - Losses for Volkswagen AG<VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud willnot exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VWspokesman said.    The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed itwould pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on1986 business, despite the provision.    One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currencydealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses fromthe currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, butthe VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit.""    VW said in a statement following today's supervisory boardmeeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal indetail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreigncurrency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditingcompany.    VW has said computer programs were erased and documentswere faked in the alleged fraud in which it believestransactions intended to protect it against possible foreigncurrency losses were not completed.    VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger wasarrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of havingevaded justice.    Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks andparent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommendan unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company hasalso set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,which were issued last year. Analysts have described the helddividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.    VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5billion marks, with the result that its total dividend paymenton 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,since the new capital was in preference shares.    The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves inorder to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. Atthe end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightlyless than three billion marks.";earn

Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad toldReuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiariesoperating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring forinvestment banking away from commercial banking and an economicslump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.    Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries inNorway since 1985.    Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway'ssecond-hand securities and equities markets, to be approvedlater this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements wouldmake profit this year.    Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, butSejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of plannedliberalisation and better economic performance, helped by asteadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.    Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's <CMB.N>subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavylosses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.;earn

"CCF REPORTS 34.8 PCT PROFIT BOOST, SHARE SPLIT SEEN    PARIS, April 9 - Credit Commercial de France <CCFP.PA>reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mlnfrancs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before itsdenationalisation around the end of this month.    Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest interms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offerahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital tothe public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.    Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it wasnationalised by the Socialists in 1982.    The sources said it was too early to give details of theplanned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as alikely date for the flotation launch.    So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale tolarge private investors to constitute a solid core of eight toten shareholders before the flotation.    The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mlnfranc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday.""The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,""CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.    Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisationat between four and five billion francs.    De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at leastthe same number of investors as <Sogenal>, another recentlyprivatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares.

"ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY<AUTHOR>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>    HOUSTON, April 8 - Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct willpropel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to recordprofits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,major company executives predicted.    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and anindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAFCorp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firmsto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, theKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping formoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy.    ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" saidPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding,""There's no major plant capacity being added around the worldnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones.""    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said.    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory.    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""Oreffice said.    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace's John Dosher.    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports.    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s.    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts.    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may beheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back onthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such asethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals thatare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.    ""Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent thepast two or three years trying to get out of the commoditychemical business in reaction to how badly the market haddeteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventuallykill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the nichemarket."" Some top chemical executives share the concern.    ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from gettingcarried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heymancautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may beill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.""    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by theSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the Texas Gulf Coast.    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products.    ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually.    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemicalbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided theU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.";earn

Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrsof medium- and long-term debt on February 22.    U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stopaccruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of ""the highpotential of a continued suspension that would result inreaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.""    Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates arereceived for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated thatfull-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.    Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiationsbetween Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to theresumption of interest payments.    The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when centralbank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt thatmatures on April 15.";earn

IRVING BANK <V> 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL    NEW YORK, April 13 - Irving Bank Corp said a six pct dropin first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely theresult of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers inBrazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.    Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrsfrom 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per sharedropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.    Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs ofEcuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter netincome by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.    Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mlndlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received onthese loans during the remainder of 1987.    Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on thetrading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,although these were partly offset by increased trust income,profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securitiesgains, the bank said.    The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.;earn

AMERICAN CENTURY <ACT> RESTATES EARNINGS    SAN ANTONIO, Tex., April 13 - American Century Corp said ithas restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan lossallowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.    The company said the change came after talks with theSecurities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgementin considering the five mln dlrs collectible.    In the note to its 1986 financial statement, AmericanCentury said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,making its loan loss provision less than required.    The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it stillfeels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986was adequate and that it has considered all relevantinformation to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlrreceivable.

WILLIAMS <WMB> SEES FLAT PIPELINE VOLUMES IN 1987    TULSA, April 8 - Williams Cos said it expected oil andfertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but saidoperating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr specialcharge was incurred.    Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipelinefrom service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams hada net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billiondlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46billion in 1985.    In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest PipelineCorp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that areamong the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gasreserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feetin 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.    The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which hasless take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, shouldshow improvement in its 1987 operating results because ofchanges tariff and federal tax rates.    The company's gas marketing business is expected to havesomewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in itsoperating region, the annual report said. The gas marketingunit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.    Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in itsdebt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mlndlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co andproceeds from the sale and leaseback of WilliamsTelecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will notbe profitable until late 1988, Williams said.;earn

GENERAL ELECTRIC <GE> 1ST QTR HELPED BY RCA    FAIRFIELD, Conn., April 8 - General Electric Corp said itsfirst quarter results were significantly higher due to thestrong results of RCA, which was acquired last year.

GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.    General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated thecompany's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GEearnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter resultsare in line with those expectations.    General Electric cited the strong results in TV network andstation operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which wasnot part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason forits strong earnings.    It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit wasmuch higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipmentsthan the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.    Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's firstquarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion ofRCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.    In addition, consumer products revenues were up from lastyear, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.    General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mlndlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves werecharged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. Itadded that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs aftertaxes from an inventory accounting change.    And technical products revenues and operating profit wereahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medicalsystems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA'scommunications and related services.;earn

"TALKING POINT/IBM <IBM><AUTHOR>    By Lawrence Edelman, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 13 - International Business Machines Corphas started the year aggressively, but industry analysts saidthe company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stopa two-year earnings slump.    ""I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than Ihave been in a long time,"" said PaineWebber analyst StephenSmith.    ""But they're not out of the woods yet,"" he added.    At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easilytopped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from aneven dollar to 1.20 dlrs.    Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM'sperformance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a fullrecovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not befelt until later in the year.    These include the success of IBM's new personal computerline, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,which will begin volume shipments in July.    In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of itsearly-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves willemerge as the year progresses.    Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers wasrelatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook thanhe has been for nearly a year.    ""Although the worldwide economic situation remainsunsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,""Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higherfirst-quarter shipments. ""We remain optimistic about theprospects for both the industry and IBM,"" he said.    ""Akers was most encouraging,"" said PaineWebber's Smith.    A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframecomputer sales all contributed to the better-than-expectedfirst-quarter results, analysts said.

Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has takensteps to improve margins.

CHEMICAL <CHL> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, EXPENSES    NEW YORK, April 13 - Chemical New York Corp said itsfirst-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.    Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mlndlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring theBrazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs inlost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrsfrom 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise wasmainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth inconsumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs ofmedium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are notresumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for thewhole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador onnon-accrual because the Quito government also suspendedinterest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interestincome by 1.5 mln dlrs.    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrsfrom 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from3.96 pct.    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, areduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculationof the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) anda narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical'scost of funds.    Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrsfrom 26.2 mln.    Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.    The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, comparedwith 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs atquarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.    Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billiondlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end ofMarch, 1986.;earn

"TEXACO SEES BUSINESS LITTLE HIT BY BANKRUPTCY MOVE<AUTHOR>    By Julie Vorman, Reuters</AUTHOR>    HOUSTON, April 13 - Texaco Inc <TX> said its decision tofile for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcycode will not affect the majority of its businesses.    It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,plant and equipment, were free of the action.    Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operatingsubsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, areaffected, it said.    But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 centsper share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repaymentson debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.    Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers weredemanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as aresult of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.    Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bondof more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp <GTY>. The bond almostmatches the damages awarded against Texaco.    Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could beginto attach its assets to secure the judgment.    Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cutTexaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back tothe Texas courts.    Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze allTexaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits ofthe Pennzoil lawsuit.    ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bondissue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco'spresident and chief executive officer, told reporters.    Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers onFriday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing untilthe end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.    Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cashbond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct ofearnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would notsell any assets, Kinnear said.    Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter ofcredit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under11.1 billion dlrs, he added.    Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said thecompany had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco onSaturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed forbankruptcy.    He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing aconfidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texacotold us they would get back to us but instead they chose to goto bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said.    Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company wouldprevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets wereample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.";earn
NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK USA 1ST-QTR NET RISES    NEW YORK, April 13 - National Westminster Bank USA saidhigher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantialincrease in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise infirst-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reporteda year earlier.    The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction ofincome as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.    Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly tomiddle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But someof these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.    Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losseswas 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.    Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at theend of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrsof loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.    The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual forthe remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reducedby about 4.9 mln dlrs.

He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in itsbusinesses and not in its dividends. ""Shareholders are betteroff if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividendsor share repurchases,"" he said.    Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the totalworldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.    He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeuticproducts, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters andlasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and willdouble that by 1995.    Wallin said, ""Our objective is to get a hold of newproducts and start building market share if we have to beg,borrow or steal to get into new markets.""    In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued witha number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulatorsalso have criticized the industry, citing quality problems anda needless overprescription of pacemakers.    ""We have no knowledge of any major problems in ourpacemakers or leads,"" Wallin said. ""We intend to re-establishour company as the quality leader in the industry.""    Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, saidthe company intends to diversify internally and throughacquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,such as drug delivery systems.    Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 doesnot include dilutions from acquisitions. ""We hope to have somesafety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutionsfrom an acquisition.""    Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivityin rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.    The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamberpacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physicalactivity.

SECURITY PACIFIC <SPC> LOANS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL    LOS ANGELES, April 8 - Security Pacific Corp said it isplacing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on anon-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce firstquarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, aftertaxes.    Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarterearnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per sharereported for the first quarter of 1986.    The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mlndlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.    Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrsof medium- and long-term debt on February 20.    Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billiondlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks sinceFebruary.    In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest paymentsfor the rest of the year because of an earthquake which haltedthe export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct thecountry's export revenues.    In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will recordinterest income only as it is received in cash.    The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach anagreement with its banks and that interest payments will resumelater in 1987.    The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New Yorkwhen Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to askbanks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of termdebt that matures on April 15.;earn

However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years.;sunseed

OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION    HAMBURG, Oct 20 - Oilmeal demand remained strong in theUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seenin the same months last year, with most of the rise coming insoymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose toa record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pcton the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal atseven pct, it said.    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago monthsfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediatelybut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, itestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes byOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year.

S. AFRICAN UNION OBJECTS TO PLANNED MATTHEY MOVE    JOHANNESBURG, June 18 - A South African trade union is indispute with a subsidiary of Britain's Johnson Matthey Plc overthe company's proposal to move a platinum refinery nearJohannesburg to a black tribal homeland.    The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers IndustrialUnion said it fears the planned move to the Bophuthatswanahomeland, where South African unions are not recognised, couldlead to job losses and affect wages.    A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum HoldingsLtd <IPLA.J> mines in the tribal homeland sent world platinumprices rocketing.    The union said talks with management over the proposed movehad broken down. It said an earlier ballot of refinery workersshowed that most favoured striking over the move but added thatno final decision had been taken on strike action.    The refinery processes all platinum metals of RustenburgPlatinum Holdings Ltd, the world's largest platinum producer.

"PLATINUM DEMAND ESTIMATED 17 PCT HIGHER BY 1991    LONDON, June 19 - Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mlnounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mlnin 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for JohnsonMatthey Plc said.    Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisationin Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase inconsumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largestsingle application for platinum.    Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was releasedin London today.    Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest furtherincrease in investment buying and may well be cautious.    He said South Africa was the most likely source ofadditional supplies and will need to increase output by about500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.    The capital investment required to produce the additionaloutput would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the politicalclimate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.    The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,Clark said.    ""The very probability of a growth in demand set against themassive investment required for expansion - and that expansiononly being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me toconclude that the price of platinum will be substantiallyunderpinned in the medium to long-term,"" Clark said.";platinum

Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsedMonday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms inretaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti shipflying the American flag.    The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.resolve that Iran ""cannot take military action against theUnited States with impunity.""    Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics andset a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger rolein making Gulf policy.

AIRCRAFT ATTACK IRANIAN OIL RIGS IN SOUTHERN GULF    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - Unidentified jets attacked three Iranianoil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday, setting at leastone of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said.    Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks hadreported that American forces launched a retaliatory strikeagainst Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oildrilling platforms and setting them ablaze.    The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhshoffshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by awave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up fromthe Rostam field soon after.    At least one of the other two targets was also believed tobe ablaze, the sources said.    The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqiair strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported anysouthern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.    Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iranused its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter andlater speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.

Officials of the foreign ministrysaid Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran andIraq, which have been at war since September 1980.    Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financialhelp to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan'scrude oil passes through the waterway.

U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION    WASHINGTON, June 2 - The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration toprovide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does notplace any restrictions on its actions.    The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirdsof those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an allianceof liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought todefeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislatorsoppose President Reagan's policies in the region.    The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17thIraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --effectively making them American ships.    The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic andRepublican leadership as well as by the administration --required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide areport to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans toprotect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.    It did not, however, place any restrictions on theadministration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships andthus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.    The Senate was expected to approve the legislation thisweek. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.

""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a shortduration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage ofthe situation,"" he declared.    Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relativelyshort-term impact on prices, he added.    Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spotprices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likelyhover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs perbarrel.    ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greaterthan the downward ones.""    ""The balance between supply and demand in the short termwill still be delicate,"" he added. ""Non-Opec production may stillgo up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increasein world demand.""    Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee whichhas been touring cartel members, said speculation may playhavoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize thesituation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.

"CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW<AUTHOR>    By Rory Channing, Reuters</AUTHOR>    KUWAIT, June 29 - U.S. moves to increase its warships inand around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks onunprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking adirect military clash with Iran, diplomats said.    They said the American decision inevitably carries somerisk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its bluntrhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.    ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into theGulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attackson ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected byAmerican or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oiltankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is ratedby diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that theIranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali AkbarHashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri topatrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escortingKuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registeredto fly the American flag to give them naval protection.    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack byIran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed byChinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran ispreparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely tomake Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up alaunching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in theFaw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.    ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaititerritory would be a very serious escalation"" likely movingworld opinion against Iran, remarked one.    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carryingout reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predictedlast Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the eventof any U.S. strike against Iran.    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accusedof being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrablecapacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now thatmost Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked topro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potentialtrouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage orother action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.";ship

U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday thatU.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulfin response to a missile strike on the American-registeredKuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.    ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S.administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.    Iran had warned the United States earlier in the dayagainst exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military actionwould endanger American interests.    Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's WarInformation Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a""crushing blow.""    ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can inno way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.    Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoidostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman onNovember 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.    Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently inDamascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help inpreventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.    Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arabstates could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, theysaid.    ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran torespond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said.    President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger Americancountermeasures if the military escalation continued.    Western diplomats and military sources in the area saidshelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative actthe United States could have taken once it had decided toretaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americansand Kuwaitis on Iran.    ""It's interesting that they chose something in internationalwaters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" onediplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the GulfArab states, particularly Kuwait.""    Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that theU.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attackedon its doorstep.""    One source said of the attack on the oil platform: ""Theymanaged to warn off the crew and hit something that was theleast nuisance to everybody.""    A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the placethey chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastatedanything because it wasn't working in the first place.""    A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:""This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).""";ship

"HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS<AUTHOR>    By ASHRAF FOUAD</AUTHOR>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf likebeacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel andconcrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one sectionof the structure remained.    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after anAmerican helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said hadbeen caught laying mines.    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defenseofficials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkwormmissiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursdayand the Sea Isle City on Friday.    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, akey backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle Eastnow with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaititankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the levelof violence and threats to shipping had increased as a resultof U.S. intervention and Iran's response.    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of aU.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, saidHarlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.    He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the deathof one thousand cuts.""    But for the United States to grab the initiativemilitarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran'sharbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which itsshipping must pass, Schuler said.    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringingIran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomaticinitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose anarms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.    He said the United States should also threaten to mine andblockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq toacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of asettlement.    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war byinvading Iran's territory in 1980.

"SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN<AUTHOR>    By Masaru Sato</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the keysupplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at leastthe next five years, oil industry sources said.    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane andbutane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on SaudiArabian LPG, the sources said.    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associateof crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. ""Saudiis a reliable supplier in that sense,"" said one trader.    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as anLPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.    ""Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulfcould easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilitiesin that area,"" said another trader.    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant atAl-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back tocontractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports fromother ports.    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on cruderather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPGsupply disruptions, traders said.    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz wasunlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatlyrise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at amoderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to liftslightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports fromIndonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases inlarge scale when Japan increases annual imports of IndonesianLPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in theyear ended March 1987, the sources said.    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase downterm purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes onthe spot market, they said.    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under termcontracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct ofJapan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has madesome concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in therecent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely theJapanese will accept the offer, the sources said.    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far beenunsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula toreplace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified byPetromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)of Arabian Light.    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftingsshould the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of ArabianLight's GSP.    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,the trade sources said.    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplyingup to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject toseller-buyer agreement.    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cutsupplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.    ""If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitablebasis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,"" saidan official at a major importer. ""Freight costs are higher forcargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to alonger haul and war risk insurance payments.""    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month tofinalise their separate contract talks, now focusing oncontractual period and volume, which could be very similar tocurrent levels, the sources said. ""When we talk business, wewould seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability ofhigh dependence on a single supplier,"" said one.";ship

"LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US<AUTHOR>    By CHRISTOPHER HANSON</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - Military experts say the United Statesfaces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of anIranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on aU.S.-flagged tanker.    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and islikely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict aslong as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launchinglimited retaliatory strikes.    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, ordestroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.    ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as thecycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard,a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic andInternational Studies (CSIS).    ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carrollof Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)think tank.    Some Middle East experts say the only way out is forWashington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end tothe war between Iran and Iraq.    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy beganescorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, whichPresident Reagan could never accept.    U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagonnews conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoelfired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostamoil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulftime (0700 EDT) on Monday.    Weinberger said the platform had been used as a militarybase by Iran and that the attack responded to an IranianSilkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker SeaIsle City on Friday.    Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance andallowed to escape.    ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we willbe prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iranwith stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.    ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said.    Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservativesagreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did notescalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question waswhether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not takenthis view after earlier clashes.";ship

JAPAN SEES MARGINAL RISE IN EDIBLE OIL DEMAND    TOKYO, April 10 - The Agriculture Ministry estimatesJapan's edible oil demand will rise 1.5 pct in calendar 1987 to1.68 mln tonnes from 1.65 mln in 1986.    Domestic consumption will rise to 1.66 mln tonnes in 1987from 1.64 mln in 1986, while imports will rise to 77,000 tonnesfrom 70,000 and exports will be unchanged at 14,000.    Edible oil supplies will total 1.75 mln tonnes in 1987against 1.73 mln last year, including domestic output of 1.60mln against 1.55 mln. Domestic supplies will comprise 725,000of soybean oil (706,000 in 1986), 638,000 of rapeseed oil(609,000) and 235,000 of other origin oils (231,000).;rape-oil
GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE    ANTWERP, June 18 - The rate of increase in world palm oiluse is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said.    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said.    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm.    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season.    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said.    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth.    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.;rape-oil

ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION    ROME, June 2 - Italy's barley crop is generally in goodcondition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, theagricultural marketing information and research board Irvamsaid.    First consignments were expected to be available aroundmid-June.    Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods ofsunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,which was expected to lose a large part of its barley cropbecause of extreme dryness.    Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's lowlevels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.    Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, nationalproduction would be around two pct higher than in the previousseason at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.

Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange PermitScheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, varioustextiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering andelectronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sportsgoods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.    The scheme replaces current rules which allow differentamounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain aminimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.    RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products willqualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotionalspending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board valueof annual export earnings.    These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw andsemi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.    RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of thetwo groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of theirfreight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.

"OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD    SINGAPORE, June 29 - OPEC has shown itself to be in controlof the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out apact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day(bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.    They said market respect for the cartel has increased sinceit announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter outputto 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.    ""There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensuredthere will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is ineffect putting pressure on end-users,"" a European crude oiltrader said.    In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, ""There's no reason to expecta weak market from now on.""    A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, ""Wethought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarterproduction so the market will react very bullishly.""    Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only aslight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmarkcrude, they expect price increases over the next few days.    August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity ataround 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but stillbelow the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.    Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and AbuDhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weakpositions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traderssaid sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.    They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices tostabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.    They said the Japanese oil market would be most affectedand Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winterrequirements before October.    Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter onEuropean and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.    ""There's no doubt consumption will be higher than productionby the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,"" said aninternational trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was lessbullish, ""For sure there will be some shortage but it depends onhow much they (OPEC members) cheat.""    A Singapore trade source said, ""There is enough cheating andleakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there isno need to worry about shortages.""    Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearishfactor to be considered.    Traders also said end-users now would buy as much aspossible on term contracts and buy spot only when the marketcooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.    Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed inthin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillatesquiet on minimal buying interest.

"INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY    BONN, April 13 - The five leading West German economicresearch institutes have failed to agree about how strongly thedomestic economy will expand this year but revised downforecasts contained in a report published six months ago.    The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essenpredicted in the institutes' joint spring report that grossnational product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, comparedwith 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecastthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlinand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.    The joint report said that the estimates of economicdevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly lessfavourable"" than those of the other three.    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after aslow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will,however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said.    The two institutes said external economic factors whichwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports woulddominate the economic environment throughout the year. They sawexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted nomarked improvement in the course of the year.    The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline indemand and production (seen) in the winter months does notindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.""    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporateuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.But they expected that many investments had not been cancelledbut only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.""    They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuationof the economic uptrend are still favourable.""    These three institutes said diminishing external burdenscombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn indemand and production could be expected by the spring.    However, this projection was clouded by risks including thefurther development of the mark against the dollar.    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said thatwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of theeconomy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exportswill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge duringthe course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fallin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.    The three more positive institutes saw private consumptionrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving butpredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline inunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said thejobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people inwork of about 200,000.    These three institutes said new jobs would be createdmainly in the private services sector and also by the state inthe context of job creation measures. The construction industrywas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980but they predicted either no rise in employment in themanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur onlyin the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in themanufacturing industry will decline.""    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw acurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marksand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start torise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all fivepredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.";jobs

"HIGHER SPENDING EXPECTED IN MALAYSIA'S 1988 BUDGET<AUTHOR>    By Ho Wah Foon</AUTHOR>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 19 - Malaysia's recovery from the worstrecession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when thegovernment announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988after seven years of austerity, economists said.    ""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh,an economist with the Institute of Strategic and InternationalStudies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment forfaster growth if the private sector is not moving.""    Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinkingone pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.    The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be undertwo pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pctbecause prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin andsemiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.    The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billionringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.    Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pctin 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.    Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmenblaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.    One businessman said too many politicians give theimpression that Malaysia was unstable.    ""If we can take care of investment confidence, the potentialto recover strongly is great,"" a banker said.    Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in theblack with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgitsurplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.    The government has said its fiscal policies will balancethe budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.    The government will also repay some of its external debt,which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.    Political leaders have said the budget will not hurtordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essentialgoods are unlikely to change.

The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congressquickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit ""could seriouslyaffect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.""    It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,running until September 30 this year, would substantiallyovershoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billiondlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.    ""The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions ofslower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for thefirst half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190billion dollars,"" it said.    While this would be 30 billion lower than last year'sdeficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate taxincreases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.    The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.    In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exportsboosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.    Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the servicesector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to beheading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumerprices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct nextyear after just 2.1 pct in 1986.    ""Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factorsbehind the avoidance of recession,"" the report said.    The current account balance of payments deficit is expectedto be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, afterhitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.    In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightlyto around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but willstill be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation isexpected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pctthis year.    Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink toaround four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at aboutthat level in 1988.";jobs

"JOINT ACTION SAID VITAL TO BOOST WORLD GROWTH    PARIS, June 18 - Prospects for world economic growth remainvery sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments isurgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilizecurrencies and encourage investment, the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.    ""The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large paymentsimbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of itsgloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.    The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc ofwestern industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's2.5 pct growth rate.    ""We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD areacomfortably exceeding three pct,"" David Henderson, head of theOECD's economics and statistics department, said.    The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to risinginflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third worlddebt problem to increase the risks of a world economicdownturn.    ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growthremain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most majorcountries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interestrates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexiblelabor markets.    But private sector confidence had been undermined byuncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""forconfidence to be restored, it is important for governmentsswiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.""    This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accordof the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.    The OECD said that apparent disagreements among majorcountries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped toundermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscalpolicies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demandin the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.    Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announcedrecently by the Japanese government to encourage public worksand cut taxes would make a significant contribution to thisprocess, though it was too early to estimate its preciseimpact.    He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domesticdemand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.    The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, hasworsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecastto rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pctincrease in 1986.    There is no prospect for any significant improvement in theunemployment situation over the next 18 months, with theaverage rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to lastyear.    The OECD called for efforts to liberalize worldagricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away fromprice guarantees and other measures linked to productiontowards direct income support for farmers.<!DOCTYPE lewis SYSTEM ""lewis.dtd"">";jobs
"ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN SLUGGISH IN BENELUX COUNTRIES    PARIS, June 19 - Economic growth will remain sluggish inthe Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment mayrise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Developmentforecast.    Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year andnext year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECDsaid in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation couldstabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surpluswill probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.    While the Belgian government has made progress in trimmingits borrowing requirement, ""it will probably be insufficient tocheck the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,"" the OECD said.    In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becomingless competitive and imports rising. ""Employment is forecast todecelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in theprivate sector and budgetary cuts,"" the report said.    Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of decliningdomestic gas prices.    Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly fastergrowth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement inwages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year.REUTER";jobs
ITALIAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK LESS BRIGHT, OECD SAYS    PARIS, June 19 - Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightlylower growth, higher unemployment and an increased tradedeficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) said.    But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast aslightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Lastyear Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growingeconomies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.    The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.    The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around fivepct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround inimport prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labourcosts and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the reportsaid.    This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demandshould be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumptionmade possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.    Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration inItalian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports andadversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result ina sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.;jobs
HIGHER GROWTH, UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE, OECD SAYS    PARIS, June 19 - France's growth rate is expected tostrengthen in the second half of this year after a poor firsthalf, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECDforecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said therate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantlyhigher than in the first half of this year.    The OECD said France's economic situation has deterioratedsomewhat during the early months of 1987.     Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventoryadjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflationhas reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely toreach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.    The report said inflation should slow and domestic demandpick up in the second half of this year. But both data arelikely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.    The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices forthe second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first sixmonths. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pctfor the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.;jobs

"U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, June 18 - Today's U.K. Economic data have pushedthe chances of another base lending rate cut from the currentnine pct further into the distance, analysts said.    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturingproduction data showed that the economy is still strong anddoes not need a fillip from lower rates.    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,taken together with higher than expected bank lending and moneysupply growth, revived inflation worries and monetaristarguments against easier credit, they said.    ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed backall the while. The strength of the economy and broad moneygrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the nearterm,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday'smortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societiessaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.Rates.    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week thata post-general election cut was imminent, supported by suchoptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise whichmirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling'sstrength.    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasmabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidlyreplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlyingaverage earnings in April, dealers said.    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lendingrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bankof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offsetthe impact on domestic money supply of its currentintervention.    ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.    ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a verygood state indeed,"" Skeoch said.    ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationarypressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost riseswere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year toApril, and it was these costs rather than average earningswhich were potentially inflationary, he added.    ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a majorproblem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worriedabout the funding implications of recent intervention.    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assetsearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes thatthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, nowlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities tryto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort GrievesonSecurities, said any fresh sterling strength would stilltrigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signalhigher inflation this year.    ""Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. Aslong as that continues we're okay,"" he added.";jobs

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT    WASHINGTON, April 9 - Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production.

"AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS    MELBOURNE, April 13 - Australia could lose valuable wheatmarkets through lack of availability if plantings for thecoming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, AustralianWheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.    ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings provetrue, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of itsvaluable markets,"" he said in a statement.    Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWBspokesman said there was a general industry feeling thatfarmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cutback plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would becut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers werefacing enormous financial pressures.    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mlnhectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and plantingintentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.    If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut inplantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developedwith much time and effort, it may have great difficulty sellingwheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.    ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheatunderstand a decrease in production due to drought but theywill have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision todecrease production,"" Condon said.    ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major exportincome earner, governments and government authorities will needto closely examine ways of contributing to the continuingviability of the wheat industry,"" he added.

"NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - The Soviets have not indicated anurgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikelythat such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summitexpected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng told Reuters.    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he didnot know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheatsubsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.    ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me thatthere's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (awheat subsidy).""    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Sovietsummit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal toMoscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate fordiscussion at a summit.    ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or theChairman would get into specific negotiations or discussionsabout,"" Lyng said.    ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary foragriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat wasnot something that would be discussed with the President of theUnited States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some majorproducing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and thestill unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any finaldecision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreementwill be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but theAgriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of thelong-standing agreement.    ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets havefailed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We wouldlove to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted fromthe agreement, Lyng said, ""I don't know. It certainly hasn'tbeen what we had hoped it would be. For three years runningthey've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was anagreement.""";wheat

USDA CHANGES LOW PROTEIN WHEAT TERMINAL PRICES   WASHINGTON, April 13 - The U.S. Agriculture Department haslowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard redwinter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, asenior USDA official said.    USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at KansasCity and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputyadministrator of commodity operations at the AgriculturalStabilization and Conservation Service, said.    The department also lowered the terminal price of hard redspring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.    In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hardred spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not tobe identified said.    The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as atPacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.    The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and rollactivity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided uponlast week and will be effective today, he said.    Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiumson high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheatprices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a proteinpremium would remain unchanged.;wheat

"EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - The European Community (EC) agreed atrade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the countryfollowing the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, ECofficials said.    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentinawill gain additional trading rights on a series of productsincluding meat, fish and cereals by-products.    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals withCanada and Japan and are due to study these again, theofficials said.    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of ECstates after West Germany withdrew objections to increasedquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,saying that the main dispute was over sales of cerealssubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, theofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade).    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership.    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on thefish dispute with Canada.    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The ECclaims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group hasimproved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfiedwith Japanese offers of compensation.    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems oncitrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for someother farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwearand to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.

FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years.;wheat

FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total worldgrain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the SovietUnion, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.

FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE    PARIS, June 1 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture'sforecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks willalmost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not besurprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.    The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'Association and the National Union of Agricultural and CerealCooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports orend-of-season stocks.    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mlnwas not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecastin mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare forsoft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 andthe record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry ofAgriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectaresagainst 4.61 mln in 1986/87.

"INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88    NEW DELHI, April 9 - India's national foodgrain target hasbeen fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchangedfrom the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in itsannual report for 1986/87.    Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterologicalsub-divisions of the country.    The report gave the targets for various crops withestimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grainsincluding sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it waspossible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifyinggrowing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along withgreater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement infertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, addingtotal foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4mln.   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnesof foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-yeardevelopment plan ending March 31, 1990.    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gapof 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining threeyears of the plan by increasing grain output annually by morethan nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only withgood weather, the report said.    ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread ofimproved technology including timely use of inputs (farmmaterials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to bevigrously pursued,"" it said.";wheat

BOMB THREATS, STRIKES AS FIJI SEES END TRADE BAN    SUVA, June 2 - Fiji today welcomed the ending of a tradeban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of thecountry's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressurefor his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.    The government welcomed a decision by the AustralianWaterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments toFiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-electedgovernment was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.    The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the uniondecision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of riceand wheat from an Australian port, the government said.

To achieve brucellosis-free status, a state's cattlepopulation must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months.    There are 33 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands,classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plusPuerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have eradicatedbrucellosis.

GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE    ANTWERP, June 18 - The rate of increase in world palm oiluse is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said.    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said.    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm.    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season.    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said.    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth.    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.;coconut-oil
"PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>    MANILA, June 1 - Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later thismonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.    ""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview.    He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position.    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground.    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research.    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether.    ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root.""    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop.    ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" hesaid.    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.    ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""he said.    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.    ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said.    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.    ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romerosaid. He said the government's proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.    ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said.    PCA figures show about one-third of the country'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land.";coconut-oil
"US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - A proposal to require importedtropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrowand possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopesthe plan would be adopted this year.    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as anamendment to a farm spending reduction package.    ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as givingAmerican consumers the information they need,"" he said.    Proponents of the measure, including the American SoybeanAssociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oilsare high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicatingtropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourageconsumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,Indonesia and the Philippines.    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible todefend under international trade law and would harm relationswith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of theirsaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relativelylittle from tropical oils.    The committee voted largely along party lines, with threeDemocrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.";coconut-oil

"LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nationsstill comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilizecurrencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at theweekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lowerrange for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank ofJapan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.    ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, andanyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret itlater on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk thedollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, henoted.    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved inmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Wouldnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollaragainst the mark or the yen.    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and141.35 yen.    ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higherinterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but thisdoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic frameworkof the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid anyfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not onlyhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debtproblem.    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise theirinterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond marketsfurther, the monetary officials said.    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declinedto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a furtherdecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationaryexpectations in the U.S.    ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvreagreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry officialsaid.    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday thatWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of WestGermany's increase in short-term interest rates.    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollardecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in theaccord, foreign exchange dealers said.    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additionalstatement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" andthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, thedealers said.    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day inTokyo currency markets.    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguisedpressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rateshigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,or international economic policy coordination.    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other'seconomic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" topersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateralsurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West Germanpolicy so openly,"" the ministry official said.    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policyshould thus be regarded as a process of healthy policycoordination and not as any indication of a possible collapseof the Louvre agreement, the official said.    He also said Japan has not received any specific requestfrom the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-termmoney rates have been edging higher.    ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not takingpolicy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal raterise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" headded.";dlr
"VOLCKER DEPARTURE REVIVES DLR, INFLATION FEARS<AUTHOR>    by Jeremy Solomons, Reuters</AUTHOR>    New York, June 2 - Paul Volcker's decision not to go for athird term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination ofAlan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns aboutthe U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stemrising inflation, financial market analysts said.    Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflationfighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing inthe U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enoughpolitical clout and monetary experience to wage a toughcampaign against inflation over the next year or two.

"FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 18 - New U.S. Banking data suggest theFederal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady pathand is not signalling any imminent change of course, economistssaid.    But they also said that if money supply growth remainsweak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 declinesuggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen itscredit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetarypolicy.    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced aforecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to adecline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrsto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 forthe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply hasfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,economists said.    ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivanof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator ofeconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concernedthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growthin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seenas better gauges of economic growth.    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, bothmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.    ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current openmarket position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the endof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.""    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowingsof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement periodwere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed hadtargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-daynet miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higherborrowings target would probably have been reached.    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness inauto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices hashelped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.    ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fedeasing at some point,"" he said.    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay littleattention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number ofyears since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in theeconomy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy isfalling apart and the Fed should ease.""    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be aprerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetarypolicy.    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term ratesfor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar andhigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and chokeoff econmomic growth.    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since lateApril. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents afundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this givesthem more room to ease,"" he said.";dlr

"J.P.

He said in response to a reporter's question after thebank's annual meeting that money market rates could declinefurther but, ""I don't think the Fed is going to encourage thatas long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are.""

"EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>    ZURICH, April 9 - European currency markets reacted quietlyto the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealersranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete tosurprise that the markets should have expected so much.    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currenciesand traded in a narrow range after the communique, whichreaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currencystabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remainingbroadly entrenched in its current trading range.    ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase BankAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.    However, she said the dollar could break out of the rangewith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltdin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady againstthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,possibly to 140 yen.    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expectsa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curbunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negativesentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbankoperators to test the downside.    Concern that finance ministers and officials still inWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour ofcurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along withworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in thelong term, the traders said.    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at thecommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar'sdownward trend.    Traders in several centres said the market would look forfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks todefend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" TheU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.    However, some dealers said London-based operators would beunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the longEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers saidthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stablemarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extremevolatility seen in the first few months of this year.    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of thecommunique made clear the leading nations did not want afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvreaccord's supposed currency target range.    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets wereready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communiquecontributing to greater stability.    ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a bigboost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said heexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marksin the next three months.";dlr

"G-7 SEEMS WORRIED MARKETS IGNORE COORDINATION<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - Top officials of leading industrialnations appear deeply worried that financial markets haveignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which theybelieve they strengthened in talks last week.    Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that themarkets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severelydisrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of thepolicy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.    Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way toreassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with astatement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladurunderscored that by saying: ""I don't believe at all that theAmericans want a weaker dollar.""    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said thedollar's latest rapid descent ""involves the risk -- now alreadya tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,leading to a renewed rise in interest rates.""    But there were signs too, that while policymakers fearedthe market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little theycould do until the economic picture changed, and currenciessettled into a stable pattern as a result.    Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week'ssemi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higherU.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapiddescent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.    Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman toldtelevision interviewers he did not think a policy of drivingthe dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.    ""It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which wouldadversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it woulddrive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not(into) recession, into slower growth,"" he said.    Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize thedollar, Balladur said: ""When a currency is maintainedartificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it isnot healthy.""    And resorting to higher interest rates could lead torecession, he said.    Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact oflife, Balladur said, ""there may be adjustments of course in oneor other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.""    But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said hemight rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.    U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted itunderstood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.    ""The United States and the six major industrial countriesare fully committed to implementing our undertakings in theseagreements,"" Baker told the meetings.    Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets whichwrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a furtherdecline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed tostabilizing currencies at current levels.    Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreedto reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fightprotectionism.    West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulatedomestic demand and lead a global upturn.    Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan'spromise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.    The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a majoraction. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stablecurrencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those atthe time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.    The Paris accord said, ""currencies (are) within rangesbroadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, giventhe policy commitments summarized in this statement.""    Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especiallyagainst the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistentwith the agreement. ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed theview that around current levels their currencies are withinranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,"" last week'sstatement read.    Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets werefocusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japanrather than prospective policy changes.

"U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, April 9  - The United States, which has longsought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to besatisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development andallows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreementto stabilize currencies.    Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announcedyesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.    But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrialpowers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.    And the initial reaction of currency markets in the FarEast demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced thatcurrencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though thecountries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one pointdespite intervention by the Bank of Japan.    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said themovement since Paris was consistent with currency tradingranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.    ""I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the pastseveral weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in thediscussions in Paris,"" Miyazawa said yesterday.    The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs wasannounced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve ofMiyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday'smeetings of leading industrial nations.    In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action""extraordinary and urgent"", the meeting reaffirmed the ParisAccord by noting that current exchange rates are within rangesbroadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.    The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, WestGermany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- thereforerepeated their willingness to continue close cooperation tofoster exchange rate stability.    The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted centralbank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt thedollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale ofintervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recentyears. Monetary sources also said they understood thatSecretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremelysuccessful in the light of the Japanese announcement.    They also said there was a growing feeling among thefinance ministers and central bankers that cooperation overmedium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-termdifferences in past meetings.    West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything likethe yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face ofyesterday's statement to have won acceptance from othercountries that its exchange rate is acceptable.    Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues thatmajor currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalancebetween West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America'strade deficit have already taken place.    No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cutthe budget deficit even though it is implied in thereafffirmation of Paris.    European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts areessential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall thatreached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.    A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier thisweek by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A furthersharp fall to redress trade imbalances would ""clearly posesubstantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and couldundermine confidence in future financial stability,"" he said.    Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force thepolitically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.    Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germanywelcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its owncurrency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.    Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weakdollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, theJapanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.    The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on makingtheir policy coordination more binding and one, CanadianFinance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.    Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summitto prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.    The United States and France, backed by the InternationalMonetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or ""norms"" for alimited number of economic objectives such as growth,inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and currentaccount balances.    Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result inconsultations between the countries on whether correctiveaction should be required.    But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectiveshas Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because itimplies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.    The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfullysounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limitcurrency fluctuations just before the February meeting.    The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret rangesof the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from therelatively free currency markets of recent years.";dlr

"POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL    WASHINGTON, April 8 - Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsaid a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciationof the mark would damage prospects for sustained West Germaneconomic growth.    In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairshere, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aimfor a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar tocorrect the trade deficit.""    He said the United States could face a vicious circle ofdepreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took thatroute.    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meetU.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and toleratingabove-target money supply growth.    He said he would have been happy to have brought forwardfive billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 tothe beginning of this year, but he said the government facedpolitical constraints getting such measures through the upperhouse of the West German parliament.    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany couldaccept on exports from a rising mark, he said.    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for aboutone-third of its gross national product, so a substantialerosion of export markets could not be offset by increasingdemand at home.    ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth,"" he said.    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy.

Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated.    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid.

"ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 9 - Economists said that they doubt theFederal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despitehigher discount window borrowings in the latest two-weekstatement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.    Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mlndlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.    ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but itprobably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings.    ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" saidWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today thatthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs ormore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss inits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewerreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.    The Fed took no market reserve management action lastThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It addedtemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reservesdirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that thetwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged onTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday'sovernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.    ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy atthis time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzisaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interestrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weakeconomies in the United States and abroad and add to thefinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders.    ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the lateststatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollartumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a newstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday'sWashington meetings of international monetary officials failedto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing inWednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view thatthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge tradeimbalance between the United States and Japan.    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming forsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly averageFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about wherethe rate has been since early November.    ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighterpolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan ofDean Witter.    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has justnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct fromsix to 6.10 pct previously.";dlr

JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS    TOKYO, June 19 - Japan could avoid a sharp rise in thevalue of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. Andother nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, anadvisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency(EPA) said.    The advisory body said in its report that the yen wouldsoar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a globalbasis were delayed.    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall toslightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed torestructure their economies.    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cutJapan's current account surplus to two pct of gross nationalproduct (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a changewould slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annuallyduring the seven-year period to 1993.    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollarwould remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan'scurrent-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. Thisscenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.    It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economyand four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.;dlr
JAPAN HAS NO PLANS FOR NEW MEASURES TO AID DLR    TOKYO, April 24 - Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa saidJapan has no plans to take new emergency measures to supportthe dollar, other than foreign exchange intervention.    He also told reporters that many major nations yesterdayintervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.    Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of thecountries involved and the amounts expended, he said.    With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japanmight take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such ascurbing capital outflows.    Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise inU.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although thegrowth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality arenot that good, he said.    He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) isexpected to come up with a final set of recommendations of waysto stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime MinisterYasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week.    Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuringby a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone, Miyazawa said itwas important to put the panel's recommendations into effect.;dlr
"BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn and Anthony Williams</AUTHOR>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - News of a meeting between U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing thedollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in greatsecrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism byBaker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fearsthat the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over twopfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.    The announcement of the meeting, also attended byBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneouslyin Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New Yorkmarkets.    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policiesaccepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministryspokesman in Bonn said.    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the marketreacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interestrates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said thatWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged tocoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, withthe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulatingtheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budgetdeficit.    West German government sources said rising West Germanmoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvrepact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interestrates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been risingsince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fedraised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.    German yields have also risen over this period, but lessmarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged upshort-term rates by changing the terms on its securityrepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering themoney market.    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany'sinability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in theBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetarygrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,bank economists said.    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from thepragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to themore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity thismorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.    ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too muchunder American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser atSwiss Bank Corp here.    ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite asignificant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating,economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms ofthe Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pacton Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money marketeconomists said.    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbankdoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocationrate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indicationthat the meeting would take place, although the FinanceMinistry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked tocomment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvreaccord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying heassumed monetary cooperation would continue.    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left WestGermany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visitDenmark and Belgium.";dlr

"U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND<AUTHOR>    BY HISANOBU OHSE, REUTERS</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 1 - The dollar's recent signs of stabilityhave raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves untilafter the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.    ""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if thedollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.    Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its valueagainst the yen and the mark as part of an officiallyorchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive onworld markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.    On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yenbut has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.    Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen farenough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.    The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in Marchfrom 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continuedimprovement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.    Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that iffurther progress is reported, the dollar would head back uptowards 150 yen.    ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomedout for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First NationalBank of Chicago.    Other factors supporting this bullish view were growingexpectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker wouldbe reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan'slarger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.    The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampenspeculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active centralbank intervention to support the dollar.    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week thatthe U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billiondlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amountsince the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.    Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's interventionvolume as ""impressive"".    James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the tradedata are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and140 yen.""    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New Yorkwarned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.""    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okadasaid market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline ofthe U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reactionto the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,which is likely to focus on the implementation of previouscommitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.    President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisionsmade last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group ofSeven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot beignored or forgotten.""    ""The commitments made at these meetings need to betranslated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear thebrunt of U.S. calls for further action.    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up onGermany to take stimulative action like Japan.""    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollarcould hold above 145 yen for some months it could also comeunder attack again if it seems the latest economic package isnot having much impact on Japan's economy and its tradesurplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trustbanks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollarpositons hedged against exchange losses in their foreignportfolios, while some others have started covering those shortpositions, Japanese bank dealers said.";dlr
"EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>    ZURICH, April 9 - European currency markets reacted quietlyto the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealersranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete tosurprise that the markets should have expected so much.    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currenciesand traded in a narrow range after the communique, whichreaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currencystabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remainingbroadly entrenched in its current trading range.    ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase BankAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.    However, she said the dollar could break out of the rangewith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltdin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady againstthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,possibly to 140 yen.    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expectsa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curbunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negativesentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbankoperators to test the downside.    Concern that finance ministers and officials still inWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour ofcurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along withworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in thenear term, the traders said.    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at thecommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar'sdownward trend.    Traders in several centres said the market would look forfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks todefend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" TheU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.    However, some dealers said London-based operators would beunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the longEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers saidthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stablemarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extremevolatility seen in the first few months of this year.    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of thecommunique made clear the leading nations did not want afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvreaccord's supposed currency target range.    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets wereready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communiquecontributing to greater stability.    ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a bigboost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said heexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marksin the next three months.    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, saidthe communique had been in line with realistic expectations andshould not have produced disappointment.    ""The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and tradepolicies to redress current imbalances are of a differenttimescale than currency markets operate on,"" the source toldReuters, ""This is a political process which takes time.""    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp inBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident oncurrency markets today. ""Did people really expect a patentremedy?"" he asked.    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was onlythe first in a series and said the market would watch carefullyin the next few weeks for any changes in positions.    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus wasnow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move byJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth couldlead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary inpushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming monthswhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle tosupport the Paris accord.";dlr

"TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN<AUTHOR>    By Rie Sagawa</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watchingnervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below thesignificant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.    ""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it isconsidered to be the lower end of the reference range. If thecurrency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichiKangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Fridaycloses of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New Yorkand 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.    ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearishsentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. Hesaid this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation amongthe group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement theLouvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-daydrop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weaknessin U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but hestrongly criticised West German moves to raise key interestrates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatiencewith some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accorddue to their fears of increasing inflation.    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationarypressures also slow domestic demand.    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings toboost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Tradedeficit, Tanaka said.    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a stillmassive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interestrates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.    ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nationscoordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchangedepartment.    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generallyconsidered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.    ""The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the nearfuture and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nationsfailing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvreaccord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,""Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as lowas 135 yen soon.";dlr

GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE    ANTWERP, June 18 - The rate of increase in world palm oiluse is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said.    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said.    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm.    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season.    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said.    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth.    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.;palm-oil

"PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>    MANILA, June 1 - Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later thismonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.    ""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview.    He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position.    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground.    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research.    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether.    ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root.""    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop.    ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" hesaid.    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.    ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""he said.    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.    ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said.    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.    ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romerosaid. He said the government's proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.    ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said.    PCA figures show about one-third of the country'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land.";palm-oil
INDONESIA SEES CPO PRICE RISING SHARPLY    JAKARTA, April 8 - Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOBsometime this year because of better European demand and a fallin Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for treecrops, told Indonesian reporters.    Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.    Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despitemaking recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that itcould possibly increase its international market share.    Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oilafter Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensuresupplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.    Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporaryshortage than to lose export markets.    Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bankfigures.;palm-oil

MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET    KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 - Malaysia is unlikely to meet itstargeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.    Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliserand overstressed palms, they said.    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil Worldnewsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely todrop sharply this year.    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell morepalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage theindustry, a leading grower told Reuters.    The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnesagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said.    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this yeardue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expectedto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oiloutput peaks.    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new treesagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reductionwill not be felt for about another three years.;palm-oil
"US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - A proposal to require importedtropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrowand possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopesthe plan would be adopted this year.    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as anamendment to a farm spending reduction package.    ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as givingAmerican consumers the information they need,"" he said.    Proponents of the measure, including the American SoybeanAssociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oilsare high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicatingtropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourageconsumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,Indonesia and the Philippines.    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible todefend under international trade law and would harm relationswith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of theirsaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relativelylittle from tropical oils.

"MALAYSIA TO RESEARCH TIN, WARY ON VEG OILS TAX<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>    BRUSSELS, June 19 - Malaysia is to urge fellow tinproducing countries to contribute more money towards researchinto new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industriesminister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview.    Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said hehad instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executivecommittee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC,to draw up a paper on the matter.    Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner FransAndriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.    He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposalsfor a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would bedefeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.    Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax wasadopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,they would be compensated through access to the EC foralternative exports.    ""Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannotsee how this would work out in our case,"" Lim said.    Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250mln dlrs a year.    The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPCmeeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.    ""Not enough research and development effort has been put inby tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutessuch as aluminium, paper and plastics,"" Lim said.    He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as anexciting possible new application.    Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra moneywhich needed to be spent on research into new uses before thenew paper was produced.    He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamentalbarriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new InternationalRubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accordinto some EC languages are still being awaited.    Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia'sbehalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said itwas important there should not be a long ""interregnum"" betweenthe old agreement lapsing in October and the new one cominginto force.

"JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS<AUTHOR>    By Masaru Sato, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, June 2 - Deregulation of Japan's oil industry couldmean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging intobigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.    They said the relaxation of controls was now under reviewby the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI).    A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bringabout a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freercompetition, we have no choice but to accept it.""    The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.    The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI itshould end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. Itshould cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct ofcurrent capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput andgasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.    They said deregulation was vital to promote morecompetition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.    ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turnto see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a sourceat one major Japanese oil company.    A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hardtime surviving, but that's something we must go through.""    ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs forthe oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching outfurther into other lines such as real estate and travelagencies,"" he said.    Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltdwhich had the largest share of refined products sales in theJapanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refiningcapacity in fiscal 1986.    Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil productsin 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, aspokesman for the company said.    Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of theCouncil, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companieswithin seven refining and marketing groups to improve theefficiency of the industry.    Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely tobe streamlined further into five refining groups.    ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups tomerge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said.    A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out thepossibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industryin the event of the relaxation of oil controls.    He declined to officially confirm or deny that thePetroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures butsaid that in principal MITI would encourage a move towardsderegulation.";acq

"PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION    WASHINGTON, April 8 - Senate Banking Committee ChairmanWilliam Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introducelegislation shortly to require greater public disclosure ofcorporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.    Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increasedthe chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.    ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for moredisclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and wouldinsure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said.    Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the thresholdfor notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that ainvestor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in acompany to three pct from the current five pct threshold within10 days, Proxmire said.    In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirementthat an investor intended to aquire three pct that would haveto filed with the SEC.    Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant toprevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public inknowing about coming takeover attempts.    Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that atender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60business days from the current 20 business days.    His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiringcompany violated the time period on the tender offer.    To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmiresaid the legislation would aim at insuring current marginrequirments are properly enforced.    The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirementfor purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generallyenforced in hostile takeovers.    Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeoverdeclare that they can raise the capital for a takeover withoutactually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.    He said his bill would allow private suits for damages forfailure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct marginrequirements.    The bill also would require more disclose when severalinvestors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.    ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to knowabout it,"" Proxmire said.    Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britaintowards two-tiered tender offers that insures that allshareholders recieve equal treatment.    He said he expected amendments to the bill also would coverdefensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.

"DOME <DMP> BENEFITS FROM TAKEOVER SPECULATION<AUTHOR>    By Solange De Santis</AUTHOR>    Toronto, April 13 - Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd postedtheir biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stockmarkets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for thedebt-heavy company.    Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange andgained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto StockExchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as highas 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Domehas normally moved by only a few cents per day.    TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlrCanadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, butDome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also stilltalking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.    Market analysts today said the other two firms are believedto be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterdaystressed that its bid is ""a Canadian solution to the financialdifficulties of Dome Petroleum.""    ""The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont<DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co <ARC>, which sold its Canadianinterest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said Wilf Gobertof Peters and Co Ltd.    David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that BritishPetroleum PLC <BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despiteBP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percentof Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own.    Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has saidin recent reports that Amoco Corp <AN> has also been in talkswith Dome.    Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.    Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as ""awfullyoptimistic,"" given TransCanada's offer to give current Domeshareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10dlrs Canadian per common share.    Under the offer, current Dome common and preferredshareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, whichwould own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanadawould own 80 pct.    However, Bryson said the market may be looking at thepotential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""TheTransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,""he said.    Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is ""at theupper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.""    The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with anotherone billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available tosecured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above acertain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.    Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billionCanadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took onseveral years ago when oil prices were high and the companywanted to expand.    ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capableof supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on thatbasis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,""Gobert said.    Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that itis a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holdsreserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billioncubic feet of natural gas.    The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acresof oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, theheart of Canada's oil industry.   Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres ofland across Canada.   The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrsCanadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be thelargest ever by a Canadian company.   ";acq

"GILLETTE <GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR<AUTHOR>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 18 - Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon GroupInc <REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for GilletteCo that could draw some big international players and in theprocess make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analystssaid.    Several hours before a regularly scheduled board ofdirectors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requestedconsent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs pershare. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed inNovember not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.    ""I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette andmore interested in putting Gillette into play because he standsto make a ton of money,"" said Andrew Shore, analyst at ShearsonLehman Brothers Inc. ""In play"" is a term used on Wall Street todescribe what happens when a company becomes an unwilingtakeover target.    Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlongets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette throughNovember of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs pershare. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain ofthree yesterday.    The agreement would be calculated on the basis ofPerelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for asplit. For example, a deal between Gillette and some othercompany at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmenreturned telephone calls seeking comment.    ""Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money ifsomeone else takes over Gillette,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj ofMerrill Lynch and Co. ""I'm not saying that is going to happenbut Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45dlrs per share.""    Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasonswhy Perelman may not be really interested in acquiringGillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlonprivate after acquiring control of the cosmetics company twoyears ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon'soperations. ""He's trying to overhaul and improve the image ofthe dearptment store business."" Another reason is that Revlonhas recently made two other acquisitions.    Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised ifsome company such as Unilever plc <UN.AS> or Procter and GambleCo <PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.    Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers forGillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc <HAN>,RJR Nabisco Inc <RJR>, American Brands Inc <AMB> and RalstonPurina Co <RAL>.    ""Perelman is trying to put the company in play,"" said aWall Street arbitrageur. ""He gets to share in the upside if thecompany is sold."" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gilletteto resist Perelman's overture. ""I can't see the boardconsenting, what has changed between November and now,"" hesaid.       Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.""Perelman never does anything without a fair amount ofcalculation,"" he said. But he added, ""The Gillette board has tobe careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued byshareholders."" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.    According to a copy of Perelman's letter released byGillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive mergeragreement without any financing condition.

MAXWELL FILES SUIT TO STOP HARCOURT <HBJ>    New York, June 1 - Publisher Robert Maxwell's BritishPrinting and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit inU.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, itsdirectors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment ofthe special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of itsrecapitalization.    The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp<FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 sharesof super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corpand the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.    The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf ofHarcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as asubstantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pctconvertible debentures.    The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds bymore than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available fordividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulentconveyance.    The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclosethat one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which itterms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable torepay it.    Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share tostockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced anextensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimedat thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.    British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of therecapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing itsalternatives.    British Printing said it filed the suit after consultationwith its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourtfailed to disclose the effect of the special dividend onHarcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.    British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormousincrease effective on the June eight record date for thedividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable uponconversion of the debentures.

"UAL <UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY    New York, April 8 - UAL Inc may have a response thisafternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its UnitedAirlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.    ""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and weneed to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, addingthat there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be releasedtoday.    The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.    Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for severalweeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developerDonald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he alsoheld discussions with its chairman.    The developer indicated in those talks that he took theposition as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.    Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buyingUAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2mln shares.    ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think thepilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,but it could put some interesting options in front of UALmanagement,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.    Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attackwhen it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertzrental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in astrategy to become a travel service company.    The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots unionconcerned that the company was not focussing enough attentionon its airline.    UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing itsnew focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.    But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street hasbeen busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL aswidespread, indicative to them that big institutions believethe stock is in play.    Market sources have said that although Trump attractedattention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as acatalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhapsthrowing the company into the hands of another buyer.    ""The first domino is you have an investor with aconsiderable stake. the second domino is the union. That typeof attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,""said Pettee.

When the deal is completed sometime in August, thecompany's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past Microsoft Corp <MFST> as the world's largest independentsoftware vendor.    Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wangtook the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.    Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computerbusinesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframecomputer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.    Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after themerger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.    On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of sixcompanies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.    For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, onsales of 141.5 mln dlrs.    The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largelybecause the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from thedark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or56 cts a share.   At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 differentbusinesses, only three of which were involved in computersoftware. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and amajor Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from hisjob as chairman of General Electric Co's <GE> computer servicesunit.    Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at anews conference that the merger would give computer users asingle source for a wide range of software products.    In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates alsosell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroadsin the applications software market, where analysts said it hasbeen successful with accounting and banking systems.    Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support andenhance both companies' product lines, but noted that thecompany will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He saidabout 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.    Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings ofcurrent Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. Butthey joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not diluteComputer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.    Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record ofcompleting acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05dlrs a share.    Wang said he would look closely at the combined operationsof the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketingand research and development.    Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.    Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said mostsoftware companies are currently valued at about 20 timesper-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth thepremium because of its earnings potential and customer base.    Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currentlyowns 58 pct of Uccel.    The executive said the merger would not alter his target ofmaintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.    In addition, he said he expects no problems in having thedeal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. JusticeDepartment.    Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after themerger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.";acq

NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA<AUTHOR>    By Irwin Arieff, Reuters</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - President Reagan's nominee as toppoliceman for the nation's securities markets will inherit anagency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stockprice gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from theglobalization of financial markets.    David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor atNorthwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursdayto be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities andExchange Commission.    If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeedJohn Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a recordsix years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.    The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as itsinvestigators have probed into the most colossal insidertrading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.    The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed inrecent months as a growing number of well known traders andprominent investment banking firms have been charged withwrongdoing.    The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November afterIvan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stockspeculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigatorsand to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegalprofits after being charged with insider trading.    But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing newphenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred bycomputer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities, options and futures. The price gyrations havecombined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedentedvolatility to some U.S. securities markets.    At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by somelawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporatetakeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeoverssteadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.    And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreignexchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundworkfor an international securities marketplace in which tradingoccurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.    Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investmentopportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforceU.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.    Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financialdisclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted tospur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency'sreview of hostile corporate takeovers.    Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Huttoninvestment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective tothe agency upon being named chairman in 1981.    In line with the views of other top administrationofficials, he favored marketplace determination of takeoverbattles over new federal regulations.    The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insidertrading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases thattopped the agency's enforcement agenda during theadministration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.    Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted withRuder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely tosignificantly alter the commission's current priorities.    The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of themlawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though thatfigure likely will be significantly higher next year as theagency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.    The agency is one of the few in the government thatactually has taken in more money than it has spent in the pastfew years because of fees it charges public companies,investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.    The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by thepresident to fixed five-year terms and protected from firingfor policy differences alone.    By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the samepolitical party, and the agency prepares its own budget requesteach year instead of leaving this to the White House.    Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its originsto the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributedin large part to widespread trading on credit and attemptedmarket manipulations by large investment firms.    The agency requires public companies and investmentvehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports ontheir financial condition and to disclose changes in theircondition any time they issue new securities.    It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks toregister with it and comply with investor protection rules, andit polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.    Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrialmagnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later tobecome the nation's 35th president.    Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who servedfrom 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon'sfirst term and was Reagan's director of the CentralIntelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.;acq

"CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER<AUTHOR>    By David Skinner, Reuters</AUTHOR>    SYDNEY, June 2 - CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> intends to proceed withits planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd<MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from <Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>(ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.    ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier'sissued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposedbid.    The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealandentrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pctstake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.    Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc <RDLD.L>, which holdsjust under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid andhad told CSR it is not a seller.    He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on itsoperations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built upa strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.    The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement withRedland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within sixmonths of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in thesame period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.    CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.    ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyonddescribing it as a long term investment.    ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which isa leader in building materials, Herbert said.    ""We fit better with Monier,"" he said.    CSR has said that it will concentrate development on itscore businesses of sugar and building materials after its movesinto energy several years ago.    Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbertsaid: ""I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has towonder if Monier is the main target.""    Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said ahigher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.    Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched itsoriginal bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.    The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents onyesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreignshareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment ReviewBoard (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.    Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likelyto accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judgethe respective values of ETL and CSR shares.    ETL is the third group to become involved in a possibleacquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on apossible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but thenegotiations foundered on the price.    Share analysts said that for this reason, they did notthink ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bidalthough Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.    ""Redland is still in the driving seat,"" said Tim Cohen of<Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier havingCSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.    Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.";acq

"SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 8 - Sumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMI.T> is certain tolose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result ofits merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.    Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bankwith an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, inOctober.    But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsutold Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain itsposition.    ""We'll be back in position in first place within threeyears,"" Komatsu said in an interview.    He said that while the merger will initially reduceSumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expandSumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area whereit has been relatively weak.    But financial analysts are divided on whether and howquickly the gamble will pay off.    Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo inview of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the mergerwas more cost effective than creating a comparable branchnetwork from scratch.    The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It hasexpanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities businessand geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned thewisdom of some of those moves.    ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Nowit's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltdfinancial analyst Simon Smithson.    Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move toenter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in Americaninvestment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.    Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being atleast, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchangepersonnel, or increase the business they do with each other.    ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because theFed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst.    But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.    ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,we can do various things. We only have to wait two or threeyears, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said.    Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routesinto the securities business at home.    Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan'sversion of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercialfrom investment banking.    But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsusaid he hopes further deregulation will create newopportunities.    ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In somecases these will be securities related, in some cases trustbank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.""    Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on suchdomestic securities business as profitable government bonddealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities CoLtd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.    He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about enteringthe securities business here through its Swiss universal banksubsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.     The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences tosecurities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,following a similar decision for subsidiaries of Europeanuniversal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.    But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similardecision on a Gottardo subsidiary.    ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowedin two or three years,"" he said.    Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expandlending to individuals and small and medium businesses toreplace disappearing demand from big business, he added.    The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot oftime to digesting its most recent initiatives, including themerger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.    ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" saidKleinwort's Smithson.    ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and jugglingaround. It will be the next decade before we see if thestrategy is right or wrong.""";acq

"TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES <BUR><AUTHOR>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</AUTHOR>    New York, April 8 - The largest U.S. textile maker focusedon its own business as its competitors found merger partners,but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itselfinto an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.    The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman andDominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pctstake.    A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointlyacquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeoveroffer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman forMontreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors.""    Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.    Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced ofthe story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors ifBurlington actually came into play.    Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that itwas looking for a takeover in the U.S.    Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Millsand has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used fora U.S. acquisition.    A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producerhas been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, butwould not say whether Burlington was among them.    ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's notunusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after thehousecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of ThomsonMcKinnon.    Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheetsand other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrslast year. It also has reorganized management, and focused itsoperations on businesses that would be less affected by foreigncompetition, Gormley said.    ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,""said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrialfabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpetsand other fabric to the auto industry.    ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the returnon the outlays they did make,"" she said.    ""You look at their record over the year, and I thinkthey're poised to be more profitable than they had been in thepast,"" Gormley said.     She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, upfrom 2.01 dlrs per share.    Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlingtonat its current levels.    Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommendsselling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earningsbasis.    Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have beenplaced on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.    ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of peopledon't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager.    Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcingmanagements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even ifhe doesn't win the target company.    Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for LuckyStores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buyingPonderosa Inc.    The stocks of other textile makers rose along withBurlington.    J.P.

"BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING <V>    NEW YORK, Oct 20 - The Bank of New York Corp <BK> said itreaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despitethe drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, aBank of New York spokesman said.    ""The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,"" aBank of New York spokesman said.    Irving would not comment on how the drop in the marketaffects its position on the bid or whether it would buy backany of its own shares.    Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequateand said it wanted to retain its independence.    In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs pershare in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for oneIrving share.    At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs pershare for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.    According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tenderfor all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.    Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop wouldaffect the acquisition.    ""If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approveit, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,""said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.    ""And the market is saying the deal won't go through,""Alpert said.    ""The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed atpresent. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs ashare, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analystsaid.    The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could affordto retain its original offer.    However, industry sources were more uncertain aboutprospects for the deal.    ""With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer willlook good to Irving shareholders,"" said Michael Flores, aconsultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.    The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which isabout a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increasesthe chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.    Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likelyto depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the bankingindustry.    ""Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't usetheir own stock to make acquisitions because their share priceis too depressed,"" Alpert said.    Since only banks can buy another bank, the only otherpossible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.

"SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING    SAN FRANCISCO, June 25 - Corporate mergers and acquisitionsin and around San Francisco over the past seven years have hadonly a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, aleading business-backed organization said.    The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 businessfirms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in anine-county area found that San Francisco itself had sufferedsome ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surroundingcommunities had not.    Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area leftdue to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, butanother 21 firms were added to the list.    Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.During the period, only six located in the city achievedFortune 500 status.    Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director ofMcKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the studygrew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriouslyhurt the economic climate of northern California.    However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had beenlost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs werecreated during the period.    At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greaterrise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the restof the United States and California.    Council President George Keller, who also is chairman andchief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a newsconference that the region had difficulties in persuadingcompanies to locate there because of a fragmented localpolitical system.    But he said that because of the amenities of living in SanFrancisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in othermetropolitan area.    ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it'sa hell of a place to do business with government.""    The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with GulfOil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from therestructuring activity.    Among the corporate headquarters lost during the periodwere Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;Cooke and Rolm.    Companies that grew enough during the period to make theFortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.    The study by the management consulting firm said that,partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growthin San Francisco has slowed since 1980.

"ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY<AUTHOR>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>    HOUSTON, April 8 - Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct willpropel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to recordprofits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,major company executives predicted.    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and anindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAFCorp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firmsto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, theKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping formoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy.    ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" saidPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding,""There's no major plant capacity being added around the worldnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones.""    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said.    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory.    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""Oreffice said.    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace's John Dosher.    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports.    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s.    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts.    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may beheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back onthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such asethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals thatare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.    ""Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent thepast two or three years trying to get out of the commoditychemical business in reaction to how badly the market haddeteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventuallykill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the nichemarket."" Some top chemical executives share the concern.    ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from gettingcarried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heymancautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may beill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.""    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by theSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the Texas Gulf Coast.    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products.    ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually.    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemicalbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided theU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.";acq

AMOCO <AN> MAY BUY DOME <DMP>, REPORT SAYS    Toronto, April 17 - Amoco Corp is apparently the successfulbidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to apublished report.    The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to thenegotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night withTransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.    No financial details about the Amoco offer were availableand a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amocohad emerged the winner, the newspaper said.    However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Domecould be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe andMail said.    Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available forcomment.    Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Domesaid it was also in talks with two other companies, but refusedto identify them.    Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco andExxon Corp's <XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary inCanada.    British Petroleum PLC <BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD>have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.    In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured bythe federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,the only Canadian company in the bidding.    Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to wantto avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the governmentgave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks toencourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts andofficials have said.    A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to runafoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada isasking for tax concessions from a federal government that istrying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,analysts have said.    A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreignoil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.    Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-basedAmoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs.

Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash andsecurities for the balance.    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.

They said even if GAF raises its offerand does not succeed, a higher bid from another company wouldgive GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.    ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst.    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would beforthcoming shortly.    ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in thisbook,"" he said.    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,protective services, which includes Wells Fargo securityguards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who followsGAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, itwould realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 pershare.    ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" saidRose.    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heymanwould do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.""    ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemicalenterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rosesaid.    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would addearnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, ifthey sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said JohnHenry of E.F. Hutton.    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billiondlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and netearnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.

"OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 13 - A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said.    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire.    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations.    TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto.    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.    ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary.    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said.    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added.    ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,"" he said.    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said.    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's.    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.    However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer.";acq

"SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS    MANILA, April 8 - A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) <SANM.MN>to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United CoconutPlanters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sourcesin the Philippine food and brewery company said.    A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPBfrom selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC'soutstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings onApril 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a formerchairman of both SMC and UCPB.    Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.    Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB andrepresented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB'splans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach offiduciary duties.""    The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also beheld up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, agovernment nominee on the company's board.    De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week bythe company's board.    On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of thesequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos pershare. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retainedearnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by thepurchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration ofdividends.    De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violatean SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debtto equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramondel Rosario as telling the board that the transaction wouldboost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.    In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earliersuit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman AndresSoriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.    De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuminglast December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kongsubsidiary <Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's boardmeeting.    An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino toresolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report byApril 15.    ""The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part ofa continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregardof the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an earlydisposition of the sequestered shares,"" San Miguel Corp said ina statement.    ""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB havereached agreement on the price of the shares and the method ofpayment, this suit is in direct contravention of thegovernment's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlementof the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added.    A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment onCojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming fromus might be interpreted as adversarial.""    Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel whichsequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligibleto buy the major portion of the shares because he was a UnitedStates citizen.    The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares,which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares whichare available to foreign buyers.    SMC sources said Soriano personally was not amongprospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased bythe <A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamedinstitutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyersin a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.    The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission onGood Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they wereowned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former PresidentFerdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in theU.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividendannounced last June.    ""We have no objection to Soriano buying the ""B"" shares,"" Diaztold Reuters. ""But everything is on hold now.""    The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversywould be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'meeting, scheduled for May 14.

"TAKEOVER BATTLE FOR DOME PETROLEUM BEGINS<AUTHOR>    By Solange De Santis, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TORONTO, April 13 - A takeover battle began today fordebt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> as TransCanadaPipeLines Ltd <TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer andDome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.    Companies mentioned in market speculation as potentialbuyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A> which is 70pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON.N>, <PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd<CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L>.    Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had anotherproposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with athird company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in astatement.    The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,but did not identify the companies involved in talks.    TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipelineoperator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, commonand preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary whichwould own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offeris to Dome management, not to shareholders.    Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.    Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violatedthe terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement enteredinto with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed toprevent Dome from considering other proposals.    It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable andsubstantial taxation concessions from the federal andprovincial governments."" But Dome added that its management andfinancial advisers will evaluate all proposals.    TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said hewas surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and deniedthat TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome'sstatement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision toauthorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announceit,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of theother bidders, or the terms of other offers.    Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on theToronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.";acq

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 9 - Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts andTelecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international forceto be reckoned with, political analysts said.    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control ofa lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,they said.    ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control ofa key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""said one diplomatic source.    ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic sourcesaid.    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does notalways help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analystssaid.    ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were notso internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor MitsuruUchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the worldcommunity and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how toface the situation.""    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row withLondon over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keepa major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete inJapan's lucrative overseas telephone business.    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rivalgroups, arguing the market cannot support more than onecompetitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which nowmonopolizes the business.    It has also opposed a major management role in the plannedmerger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm onthe grounds that no such international precedent exists.    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which hasthreatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the mergerplan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to openits telecommunications market.    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which itsays have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's cartelephone and satellite communications market.    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of thesector it regulates.    ""What has been happening is an important shift in theeconomy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" saidJames Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia AdvisoryService Inc.    A decision to open the telecommunications industry tocompetition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boostedrather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.    ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de factolegal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst DarrellWhitten.    Close links with the powerful political faction of theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former PrimeMinister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, theanalysts said.    ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanakafaction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importanceof MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members ofthe influential political group, he added.    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due tothe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in thePostal Savings System, analysts said.    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulateinterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financialliberalisation, since the change would remove the PostalSavings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates thanbanks, they said.    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT'sobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterizedthe ministry as feudal.    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limitingcompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under itswing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowestprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those ofits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western worldincluding Britain, several analysts said.    ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep orderin utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonableview,"" he said.";acq

"USPCI <UPC> SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID    CHICAGO, June 1 - USPCI Inc likely will reject a 43-dlr-a-share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), analysts said.    ""The offer is inadequate,"" said Douglas Augenthaler, ananalyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent theneeded premium over the company's fundamental value based onearnings estimates.    USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at48-1/8, down 3/8.    USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he couldnot comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the boardwould meet to consider it.    Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcementthat same day of higher earnings expectations changed itsvalue. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceedanalysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.    At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in thelow 40s, Augenthaler said.    Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the wastemanagement concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on theannouncment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.    In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste managementbusiness holds significant growth potential.

The industry is expected to continue growing at15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.    Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrstotal, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportationand energy company would both gain entry into a profitablebusiness and win cost-control benefits, he said.    ""Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairlysignficant environmmental problems of its own,"" he said.

The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc <em>for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder EddieAntar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canadaannounced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.    Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues andprofits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into thehighly competitive New York City retail market for consumerelectronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes ofelectronics retailers have sagged.    The analysts questioned whether Houston-based EntertainmentMarketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whosepresent buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, hadthe management expertise for retailing or was merely trying todrive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.    ""I have mixed feelings,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow ofEppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. ""On the one handit's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, doesEntertainment Marketing have the management talent to run itand will the Crazy Eddie people leave?""    ""It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,"" saidanalyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, aMinneapolis brokerage. ""Electronics retailing is very managementconcentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management inplace.""    Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing alreadyowns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it maybe trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its7-dlr-a-share offer.    Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid wasannounced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a sharein over-the- counter trading.     Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New YorkCity, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month thathis group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.    A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has takenno decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrssince they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. Hewould not comment on the new offer.    Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such asdisk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods toretailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly toconsumers by cable television.    In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profitwent to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.    Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said ina statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchaseof Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc toassist in financing the balance.

Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization planas an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholderswould receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subjectto approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held inJune.    The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mlndlrs in debt to finance the payout.

Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted intoSeries A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby anindependent investment baking firm.

"INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC<AUTHOR>    BY LAWRENCE EDELMAN, REUTERS</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 1 - The investor group that has agreed tobuy <Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personalcomputer retailer public or sell it to other investors,industry analysts said.    ""Now's a good time,"" said Joe Levy of International DataCorp. ""The personal computer industry has bottomed out and ison the way up again,"" he said.    Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PCretailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought byan investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.    Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management andventure capital firm, would disclose the value of thetransaction.    Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 storesgenerated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners payroyalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.    Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions toComputerland. Computerland officials could not immediately bereached for comment.    E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venturecapital funds, and its past investments have included MattelInc <MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a moneymanager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.   Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strongupturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make keychanges if it is to fend off advances from rivals likeBusinessland Inc <BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's <TAN> Radio Shackstores. ""The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,customer service and customer support,"" said Levy ofInternational Data.

"PHELPS DODGE <PD> SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 2 - Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. RobertDurham said the company is prepared to make another largenon-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in thenear future.    In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company wasexamining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.    He declined to name the companies but said a deal couldoccur as soon as the second half of 1987.       Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer inthe U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian ChemicalsCo, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tiresamong other products.    The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify andeventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copperoperations.    Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrsto buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.       Any acquisition candidate would have to have a differenteconomic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and goodmanagement, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendlydeal, he added.    ""We're not talking high-tech, or financial services orabout a perfume company,"" he said. ""We want a good basicindustrial company that will fit into our managementstructure,"" Durham said.       During the interview, Durham and other executives also saidcontinued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead tohigher prices for the metal.    ""In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price(for copper) will improve because there aren't that many newprojects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,will continue to grow modestly,"" said executive vice presidentDouglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost ofproducing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest andcorporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.    Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound nowcompared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analystssaid.    Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have beenfor almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.    He declined to project results for the second quarter oryear. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise incopper prices in the last month will help results.    Durham said last month that the second quarter should matchthe first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mlndlrs or 49 cts a share.    First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increasedcopper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, alsoacquired last year.

SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES    WASHINGTON, June 29 - The Securities and ExchangeCommission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptlydisclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart atakeover attempt by Campeau Corp.    In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and itslegal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and theagency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shoppingcenter developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau'stakeover offer.    Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrson Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.    On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board hadurged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs ashare, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shoppingcenters to DeBartolo, the SEC said.    Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who headsthe merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm ofSullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SECfiling to disclose the talks even though they had resulted insales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.    Securities law requires takeover target companies topromptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.    The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pctof Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs ashare from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headedby DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed atthwarting Campeau, the SEC said.    Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in anamended SEC filing, the agency charged.    Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover wasmade on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaintsaid.    DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle forcontrol of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in Octoberwhen it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutesafter it dropped its hostile tender offer.    The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federaljudge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake inAllied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.    The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joiningwith Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegaltender offer.    But the SEC brief was never filed since the case wasdropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.    In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they complywith reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.    Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since itbecame a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual andquarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.;acq

But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mlndlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another partyholding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.    The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in anytender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealermanager services or for break-up of the deal.    Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group ofinvestors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tenderoffer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.    The company's board has approved the plan, which wasintended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.

Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possibleleveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.

In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will alsoget up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses inthe tender offer.    Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warneras a subsidiary with its current officers keeping theirpositions.    But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it isconsidering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number ofsubsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.

Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debtof Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.    To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects toborrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mlndlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs ofnon-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynchand Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes toMerrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs ofsubordinated discount debentures.

"BURLINGTON <BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW    Greensboro, N.C., June 1 - U.S. District Court Judge EugeneA. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow onBurlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stopSamjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.    Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case couldbe pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeoverbattle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.    Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyersfor Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by DominionTextile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.    Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminaryinjunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer untilthe case is decided.    Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlrbuyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MS>, one dlr per sharelower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjenslast week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjensoffer.    Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman andDominion used illegally obtained confidential information aboutthe company in making their takeover attempt.     That information, Burlington said, was provided by JamesAmmeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebberGroup Inc <PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington'ssales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never todivulge inside information about the company.    Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he beganworking with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to""takeover the company, dismember the company and displace itsmanagement,"" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.    Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information fromPaineWebber, but argued the information was public informationand could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts orBurlington's public financial statements.    Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met withEdelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet withthem until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion wentpublic April 24 with their intention to take over the company.Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt atakeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board inFebruary.    Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion helddiscussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting asfinancial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke offbecause Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman anddominion with a written statement that they did not provideinside information.    Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeenwithdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairmanFrank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive andthreatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in aneffort to takeover Burlilgnton.    ""The ultimate question is not the price per share or theprofit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct forthose who would takeover an American company,"" said burlingtonlawyer Humphrey.    Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as thelargest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be inviolation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada'slargest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plantsin Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,the lawyers said.    Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said themarket for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contendsand that Burlington has the ability to switch between lightweight and heavy weight denim production as demand and pricedictate.    Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed byBurlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bidfor Dominion. ""Surely, what would have been sauce for the goosewould have been sauce for the gander,"" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,a Samjens lawyer.";acq

"OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS<AUTHOR>    By Larry Welsh, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 12 - A 3.22 billion dlr offer for DomePetroleum Ltd <DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd <TRP.TO>may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the doorfor more takeover bids, oil analysts said.    Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debtof more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interimdebt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defersubstantial payments to creditors will expire.    Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholdersthat an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.    Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well aspublic noteholders in March after several months of delicatenegotiations.    TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debtrestructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin NiskerLtd said from Toronto.    Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allowcreditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yetto be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked tocash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.    ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is thateven with approval of creditors, there is no assurance thatDome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd inCalgary.    TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Domewas waiting for responses from creditors on its proposedrefinancing packages, Gobert said.    The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Domesince other potential buyers were probably waiting for lendersto agree to a restructuring, he added.    ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertainany and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.    Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York thatTransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fixthe bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude otherpossible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention tous in our discussions, it means that others may be a littlereluctant to come forward,"" he said.    Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formaloffer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached aconfidential agreement between the two companies, he said.    Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussionswith TransCanada in order to pursue talks with otherunidentified parties. However, Dome said its management andfinancial advisers would evaluate all proposals, includingTransCanada's.    Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair pricefor the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.    However, he said not enough financial details are knownabout Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value ofTransCanada's proposed offer.";acq

"CHEVRON N.SEA FIND MAY HOLD 300 MLN BBLS -ANALYSTS    LONDON, June 29 - A North Sea oil find announced by ChevronCorp's <CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate anew field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mlnbarrels, industry analysts said.    Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 APIcrude oil from the tertiary ""Alba"" sand through a three-inchsurface choke.    ""The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320mln barrels,"" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grievesonand Co told Reuters.    He said industry estimates put the total reserves at thefield at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity ofoil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25pct.    Analysts said the results were encouraging, but thepotential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in thefield was shown by the fact that the first well had to beplugged and a sidetrack drilled.    ""The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which willrequire a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costsup,"" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.    Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oilfound would require additional costs in recovery, the test wellshowed that it flows well.

"NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY    OSLO, June 29 - Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback inplanned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helletold Reuters.    ""We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,""he said. ""The accord reached there means stability in the oilmarket and we shall continue making our contribution.""    The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, wouldprobably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Hellesaid. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies andwould now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.    OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 andretained the fixed prices that were set in its December accordbased on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.    OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, andit's December pact had provisionally set a third quarterceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourthquarter.    Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshorefields, previously said it would continue its output curbs fromplanned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remainedwithin its December accord on output and prices.    Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mlnbpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.    The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented sinceFebruary reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.    Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland fora meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statementon the latest oil production cutbacks.    Over the past year several other leading non-OPECproducers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysiaand Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keepprices stable.    Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following anOPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.    Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total exportearnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil priceduring the first half of 1986.    But firmer oil prices since then have brought somestability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign tradedeficit.     Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistentlyrefused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up tothe producing oil companies to set the levels of production.";crude

"JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS<AUTHOR>    By Masaru Sato, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, June 2 - Deregulation of Japan's oil industry couldmean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging intobigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.    They said the relaxation of controls was now under reviewby the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry (MITI).    A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bringabout a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freercompetition, we have no choice but to accept it.""    The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.    The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI itshould end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. Itshould cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct ofcurrent capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput andgasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.    They said deregulation was vital to promote morecompetition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.    ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turnto see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a sourceat one major Japanese oil company.    A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hardtime surviving, but that's something we must go through.""    ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs forthe oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching outfurther into other lines such as real estate and travelagencies,"" he said.    Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltdwhich had the largest share of refined products sales in theJapanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refiningcapacity in fiscal 1986.    Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil productsin 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, aspokesman for the company said.    Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of theCouncil, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companieswithin seven refining and marketing groups to improve theefficiency of the industry.    Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely tobe streamlined further into five refining groups.    ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups tomerge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said.    A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out thepossibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industryin the event of the relaxation of oil controls.

Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output atseveral of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production atfields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk fieldrescue project.    Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway'svoluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oiloutput, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabiliseoil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.    Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend theproduction restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on allits North Sea fields for the rest of the year.    Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norwaywould extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.

Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which usethe Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August whilePhillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.

December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents beforefalling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.

Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPECproduction could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter andInternational Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC Septemberproduction at 18.5 mln bpd.    The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit ofa Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the SeaIsle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flagcommercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.    The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in thearea on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.    Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil onMonday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.Attack, analysts said.    They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through whicharound eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not inthe interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.    Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase inthe number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulfhostilities, analysts said.    But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranianmissile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.    Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.    ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspondto Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that anyfurther action will be met with a like-for-like response.Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said.    Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""aresponsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating toIran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iranchose to raise the level of conflict.    Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.    He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved asArab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose intereststhe U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as aresult of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranianretaliation.    The initial upward market move this morning reflected astrong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack whichwas thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missilelaunchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.

"CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW<AUTHOR>    By Rory Channing, Reuters</AUTHOR>    KUWAIT, June 29 - U.S. moves to increase its warships inand around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks onunprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking adirect military clash with Iran, diplomats said.    They said the American decision inevitably carries somerisk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its bluntrhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.    ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into theGulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.    Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attackson ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected byAmerican or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.    The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oiltankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is ratedby diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that theIranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.    Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali AkbarHashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""    The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri topatrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.    The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escortingKuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registeredto fly the American flag to give them naval protection.    Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack byIran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.    Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed byChinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran ispreparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.    The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely tomake Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.    A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up alaunching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in theFaw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.    ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaititerritory would be a very serious escalation"" likely movingworld opinion against Iran, remarked one.    Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carryingout reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.    Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predictedlast Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the eventof any U.S. strike against Iran.    Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accusedof being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrablecapacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.    Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now thatmost Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked topro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potentialtrouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.    Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage orother action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.";crude

"U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING<AUTHOR>    By SUSAN SHERER, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 19 - U.S. crude oil prices are at theirhighest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPECmeeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect anypolicy changes from the session.    They said prices, which have steadily climbed since theorganization's accord in December, have risen on technicalfactors within the market and concerns about supplies becauseof the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from theGulf.    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is tradingaround 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York MercantileExchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is itshighest level since January 1986.    OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria'soil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna tobe brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and productionagreement may only need a slight review.    Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmationof the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due toa desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.    Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soonafter the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increasedtension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, pricesshould begin easing.    ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreedto in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, avice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.    OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mlnbarrels in the fourth quarter.    This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, risingfrom 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.    Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and areduction in output.    ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues totrade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance thatOPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said NaumanBarakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.    But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, suchas Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.    ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in theofficial prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, arecommitted to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua,analyst with L.F. Rothschild.    However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meetingin September to re-evaluate market conditions.    Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in thefourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels aday and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, presidentof Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.    Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at thismeeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs tooffset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominatedthroughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,producers receive less money for their oil.    ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,""said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.    ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not toproduce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore actas a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a twodlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" hesaid.    One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.    ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the PersianGulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurites.    Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have beenregular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administrationis planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of theU.S. flag, with naval escorts.

"MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS    NEW YORK, June 1 - Flooding in the Red River on theTexas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels perday of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, aTexaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.    ""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get anydivers down to assess the damage but there is some possibilitythat the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a companysource said.    The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude andone-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.    Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service isrestored by Friday there would be little problem in restoringoil which has been lost to the flood.    ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will bedifficult to make up without prorationing and we would not liketo proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.""    The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic RichfieldCorp <ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/ShellGroup <RD> and Texaco Inc <TX>, which is the pipeline'soperator.     Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crudeoil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose tonew highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.    July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.    Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers ofWTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.    Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipelineshutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with WestTexas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr abarrel below WTI, respectively.    Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs atTexaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five daysbut that will depend on when the water level of the Red Riverrecedes. There is already evidence that the water level isdropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the areaaffecting the pipeline, Stevens said.    He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged wasunderground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoilnearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil wasapparently washed away.       The potential for environmental damage is being downplayedat this time despite the volume of oil that runs through thisline.

"HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS<AUTHOR>    By ASHRAF FOUAD</AUTHOR>    BAHRAIN, Oct 19 - Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf likebeacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.    One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.    The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel andconcrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.    The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one sectionof the structure remained.    U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after anAmerican helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said hadbeen caught laying mines.    But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defenseofficials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkwormmissiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursdayand the Sea Isle City on Friday.    Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, akey backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.    Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle Eastnow with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaititankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.    But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the levelof violence and threats to shipping had increased as a resultof U.S. intervention and Iran's response.    The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of aU.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, saidHarlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.    He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the deathof one thousand cuts.""    But for the United States to grab the initiativemilitarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran'sharbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which itsshipping must pass, Schuler said.    He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringingIran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.    Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomaticinitiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose anarms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.    He said the United States should also threaten to mine andblockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq toacknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of asettlement.    Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war byinvading Iran's territory in 1980.

"U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL    SAN FRANCISCO, April 9 - The United States' dependency onforeign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,according to John H.

Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conferencehere, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as muchas 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous highlevel of 47 pct in 1977.    ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil isinevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oilimports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to40 pct by 1990.    ""However, the rate of this growth can be affectedpositively or negatively through government action orinaction,"" Lichtblau said.    He said that one of the government's negative actions isthe maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as adisincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cashflow for oil exploration.    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floorprice for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.    ""An international floor price adopted by all or mostindustrial countries would clearly be a much more effectivemeasure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than ifwe imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.    Development of alternate energy sources such as syntheticfuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessenU.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.

"FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY    TOKYO, June 29 - OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boostspot prices and enable the group to raise its officialreference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.    ""Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and theofficial price will be 20 dlrs in January,"" a Japanese refinersaid.    The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPECmembers such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait andQatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.    Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading asthe market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrsfor Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs forU.K. Brent, traders said.    They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked intothe U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate(WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.    ""With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will importMideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen thosegrades further,"" said a Japanese oil trader.    Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spotmarket has further upward potential in the short term, havingrisen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.    ""You could certainly argue that if New York rose on thatbasis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,"" saidone international oil trader in Tokyo.    ""But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be boughtback up again pretty quickly,"" he added.    One oil industry analyst concurred, ""There is no reason toexpect a weak market from now on."" He said he expected OPEC toraise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.    Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge stronglyin the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members andthe likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer tomaintain steady prices.    Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per daycompared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Itsexport capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipelinethrough Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.    Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting upto 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.

LUKMAN SEES STABLE OIL PRICE FOR NEXT COUPLE YEARS    STOCKHOLM, June 2 - The current crude oil price of between18 and 20 dlrs a barrel will remain stable over the next coupleof years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum tokeep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.    Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish tradeofficials, said the stable price depended upon output restraintby both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish governmentofficials said.    They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, madethe remarks whilst talking about the connection between ThirdWorld debt and industrialised nations.    Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higherenergy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.    Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around thebeginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrialcountries that depend on imported energy, they would only leadto wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, hesaid.    This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely highprices, he added.    Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a majorcrisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.;crude
ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION    QUITO, April 13 - Ecuador will resume limited crude outputnext week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oilto a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state EcuadoreanPetroleum Corp (CEPE) said.    CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuadorwould begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude innortheastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week inpreparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up toneighbouring Colombia.    Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when anearthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacificport of Balao.    It will take at least until the end of July to repair thepipeline and return output to normal levels. The country waspumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.    To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador isconstructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting pointof Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.

"ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY<AUTHOR>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>    HOUSTON, April 8 - Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct willpropel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to recordprofits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,major company executives predicted.    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and anindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAFCorp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firmsto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, theKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping formoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy.    ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" saidPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding,""There's no major plant capacity being added around the worldnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones.""    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said.    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory.    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""Oreffice said.    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace's John Dosher.    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports.    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s.    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts.    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may beheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back onthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such asethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals thatare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.    ""Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent thepast two or three years trying to get out of the commoditychemical business in reaction to how badly the market haddeteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventuallykill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the nichemarket."" Some top chemical executives share the concern.    ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from gettingcarried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heymancautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may beill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.""    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by theSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the Texas Gulf Coast.    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products.    ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually.    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemicalbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided theU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.";crude

"US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - U.S. military planners ruled outIran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attackmounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into theIran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.    U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform andraided another in what the administration called a ""measured andappropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack lastFriday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.    Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rigrather than an onshore economic or military target such asSilkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington tolimit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both athome and in the Gulf.    ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take militaryaction when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, adefense analyst and author, said.    He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran theembarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoidingan escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.    In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and thepotential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft thatcould have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.    Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraqwar, said the United States apparently chose a limited targetto keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept aSecurity Council call for a ceasefire.    ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's anychance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it cleartougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.   In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagonto have been turned into a military command post -- Washingtonalso sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran'seconomic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform hadbeen used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in thelower Gulf.    ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shownIran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exportingcapabilities,"" Cordesman said.    He predicted the United States would respond to any futuremajor Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at BandarAbbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining theapproaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.

"LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US<AUTHOR>    By CHRISTOPHER HANSON</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - Military experts say the United Statesfaces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of anIranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on aU.S.-flagged tanker.    The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and islikely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict aslong as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launchinglimited retaliatory strikes.    But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps-- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, ordestroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.

Some Middle East experts say the only way out is forWashington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end tothe war between Iran and Iraq.    They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy beganescorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, whichPresident Reagan could never accept.

"OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS<AUTHOR>    By Judith Matloff, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, June 18 - Some OPEC states are unhappy about theprices assigned to their crude oil but this should not posegreat problems when the group reviews its six-month-old priceand output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.    They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conferencepresidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievancesabout price differentials making some of their crudesuncompetitive.    There has also been speculation by Japanese traders thatOPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.    But most experts agree that a major overhaul of pricedifferentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the marketsignals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.    ""All OPEC members can make a good case for changingdifferentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""Butat the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave wellalone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.""    Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also sawsales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminishedcustomer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,marketing incentives have helped their sales.    Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes bymeans of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongsidebetter priced grades in a ""package.""    Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at leastfor some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC shouldchange prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand forfuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. Atits last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixedprices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel referencepoint. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985when members offered discounts to attract customers.    OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarterand 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extendor raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.    Spot market and netback values for some crudes do notmirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlrtarget and at most make minimal changes to differentials,analysts say.    The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and onenon-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key exportcrudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.    Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oilexports actually sold at official prices. Several experts sayonly one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells atofficial prices, with some of the rest included in processingor barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.    Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance topay the new prices.   Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude-- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.    In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank belowits 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output hasrisen.    Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and sayits price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.    But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's KleinwortGrieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push thedifferentials question in Vienna.    ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, whichholds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said.";crude

"PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE    TOKYO, June 1 - Crude oil prices could remain around 18dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision onoutput at its next meeting would be the critical factor, anofficial of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos(Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.    Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president ofinternational trade, said current OPEC output already appearedto be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itselffor the third quarter. ""Production is surging ahead of what wasoriginally planned, while demand is growing more slowly thanenvisaged a few months ago,"" he said.    He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level ofproduction in the third quarter would effectively sustain the18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally beenenvisaged might soften price levels.    The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 inVienna to review its December accord on prices and output.    ""I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude interms of volume decisions,"" Lajous said.    A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boostedoutput and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, isalways there as a possibility, he said.    ""I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. Iexpect other oil exporters have learned their lessons anddiscipline will be maintained,"" he said.    Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long asthis remains there will be a tendency to instability in oilmarkets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during1987 if output remains under control.    He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, thatincreased production was not so important as long as incomeswould not be affected by the output, were ""very relevant andwelcome from such a powerful producer.""";crude

"TEXACO <TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED<AUTHOR>    By SAMUEL FROMARTZ, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 13 - Texaco Inc has re-established some keyoil supply lines following yesterday's court filing forprotection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, saidElton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.    ""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,""Yates told Reuters in an interview.    The company last week had stated that a number of domesticand international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oilshipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.    Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and other banks toldTexaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texacosaid in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB> and J.P.Morgan Co's <JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for depositsto cover transactions, it said.    The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arosefrom an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. SupremeCourt in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> overthe acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.    The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco'splea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.    ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as theycould,"" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Courtruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and haltingsupplies.    ""It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into anavalanche,"" he said. ""Supplies were cut to the point where wecould not run the system at anywhere near capacity.""    He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been injeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortagesby mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Eltonsaid.    It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,Occidental Petroleum Co <OXY> demanded cash for crude, andAtlantic Richfield Co <ARC> asked for special safeguards.    The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC <BP> lastweek refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates todaysaid, ""a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go onsupplying. They had cancelled last week.""    He declined to identify the company.    <Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oilcompany that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, alsohalted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.    But he added that Texaco expected to meet with theVenezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that keysupply line. Talks were also expected to take place with theAlgerians, he added.    Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit linesand oil supplies that are key to the company's business.    ""It will be business as usual for Texaco,"" said MartinKlein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyerand Traub.    ""Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said.

Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, wholooks for a build said, ""We have had five weeks of gasolinedemand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off tobetween 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latestreport for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasolinedemand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.

UNOCAL<UCL> SCRAPS FLUIDIZED BED BOILER PROJECT    LOS ANGELES, June 19 - Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bedcombustion technology, a method for the more efficient burningof solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Coloradodue to high costs.    Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. SyntheticFuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology atthe oil shale plant. In return the company would have beeneligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supportsfrom the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contractfrom the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.    Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidizedbed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.    The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat andelectricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.    Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investmenttax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the projectuneconomical even with government price supports and loanguarantees, Unocal said.

COMPROMISE SEEN LIKELY OVER CONOCO-STATOIL DISPUTE    OSLO, June 1 - Norway is expected to seek a compromisesolution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats OljeselskapA/S <STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firmwill operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.    The sources, who asked not to be named, said the governmentwill likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as thefield's operator through the development phase, with Statoiltaking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.    Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government hadtoday discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decisionhad been taken and several questions remained unresolved.    It was unlikely the government would announce its decisionon Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meetingand after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,the sources added.    This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoilexercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration licensethat, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieveConoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised byConoco.    Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry asthe most likely candidate for the first field developmentproject on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off centralNorway.;crude

SAUDI OIL RESERVES RISE DESPITE HIGHER OUTPUT    JEDDAH, June 19 - Proven oil and gas deposits in SaudiArabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, accordingto the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.    Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ftfrom 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.    Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between SaudiArabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels perday in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.    Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, asOPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapturetheir share of the market. In the process, prices collapsedfrom about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until theorganisation decided to cut production again from lastSeptember onwards.    Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.    Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightlyto 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on theofficial Saudi Press Agency.    The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in thenumber of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.    Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant wasupgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enablingit to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, thereport said.    The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned byanother state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- producedaround 750,000 bpd last year.

Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesdayat the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.

Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the SovietUnion, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before heleft for Moscow.

"OPEC OUTPUT IN MAY SEEN OVER CEILING AT 17 MLN BPD LONDON, June1 - OPEC's May output appears to have risen well above its 15.8mln bpd ceiling to 17 mln bpd, and the increase is likely toput a short-term lid on spot oil prices, Kleinwort GrievesonSecurities says.    But Kleinwort's latest World Oil Report said re-stockingand lower non-OPEC output earlier this year should allow thegroup to produce up to 17 mln bpd in the current third quarter.    ""On the supply/demand front, the market continues to enjoy adegree of stability rarely seen in recent years,"" it said.    It said most OPEC members were overproducing slightly butonly the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was seriously above quota.    The report said Saudi Arabia had been sending clear signalson the need to maintain oil prices at current levels of around18 dlrs a barrel and adopt provisional output rises agreed inDecember when OPEC meets in Vienna on June 25. If OPEC adoptsthe provisional ceilings of 16.6 mln bpd in third quarter and18.3 mln bpd in the fourth, there will probably be room foroverproduction in the third quarter when demand for its crudewill probably be 17.5 to 18 mln, it said.    It said that the UAE and Ecuador may demand higher quotasin Vienna, but the biggest obstacle is Iraq, which has refusedto honour its quota as it is less than that of Gulf War enemyIran.    But OPEC appears committed to a short meeting and realisessomething must be done about the Iraq issue, the report said.    According to Kleinwort's sources, Saudi Arabia has alreadyheld separate talks with Iran and Iraq and is urging Iraq to bemore moderate.    ""One strong indication that some kind of deal may beeventually worked out is the almost complete silence comingfrom Iran,"" it said.    Indications are that, in return for going along with theSaudi desire to maintain official prices in Vienna, Iran isseeking concessions from the kingdom on the Iraq issue, itsaid.    Kleinwort said the kingdom will face an increasingly uphilltask in trying to maintain prices around 18 dlrs beyond 1987.    Firstly, OPEC hardliners led by Iran are bound to opposesuch a move. Secondly, other OPEC members will press foranother price rise if the dollar remains weak against othercurrencies.    Thirdly, Saudi Arabia may be forced to raise prices earlierthan it intended to ward off growing calls for higher pricesfrom the U.S. To stimulate domestic drilling and exploration.    The report concluded that there is a strong possibilityofficial OPEC prices will rise to 20 dlrs a barrel by end-1987and 22 dlrs a barrel by end-1988.";crude

It had no meeting scheduled with the other three strikinglocals, which rejected a tentative three-year contractSaturday, Cominco spokesman Richard Fish said.    Fish said the pact that was rejected contained a cost ofliving increase tied to the Canadian consumer price index, butno wage increase. With 81 pct of the membership voting, 54.5pct voted no and 45.5 pct voted yes, the union said.    The three locals represent about 2,600 production andmaintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about600 office and technical workers.    The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since thestrike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare forcemajeure, which means the company may be unable to honorcontracts for products from the smelter and mine.    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.    The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons oflead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 mileseast of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,most for processing at the Trail smelter.    The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.    Trail smelter revenue was 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986.;strategic-metal

JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT    TOKYO, June 18 - Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pctfrom 2.1 pct.;meal-feed

"DUTCH FEED COMPOUNDER STARTS CASE AGAINST EC LEVY    ROTTERDAM, April 13 - A major animal feed producer, CehaveNV Veghel (CHV), has begun legal proceedings against theapplication of the European Community grain co-responsibilitylevy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feedtrade association, Het Comite, association chief executivePeter Pex told Reuters.    Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and thecourt said it would give its verdict within six weeks. ""However,that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court torefer questions on the interpretation and application of thelevy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg,"" Pex added.    Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not takeaccount of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean acompounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy inits own national currency than it received down the chain fromthe original producer of the grain.    ""We would like the Business Administration Court in theHague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whetherthe Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but alsowhether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,""Pex said.    ""It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,but we have had no political help, and therefore have no optioneven though it could take years,"" Pex added.    Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against thegrain levy because the bill the company received from thecommodity board included grain from a wide variety of originsand was therefore considered to be the best general basis for alegal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.    Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions onthe levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a casebrought by the Association of European Animal FeedManufacturers, FEFAC.";meal-feed

"PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>    MANILA, June 1 - Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later thismonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.    ""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview.    He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position.    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground.    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research.    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether.    ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root.""    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop.    ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" hesaid.    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.    ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""he said.    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.    ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said.    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.    ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romerosaid. He said the government's proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.    ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said.    PCA figures show about one-third of the country'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land.";meal-feed

"SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY    CHICAGO, June 2 - Nearby months in soybean and soymealfutures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply oflivestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep thenew crop outlook bearish, traders said.    ""A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worriedabout where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,""one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers forthe few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with aDecatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bidanother two cents today to 10 over July futures.    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willingto sell, dealers said.    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the beliefthat even if futures rally back to last month's highs, countrymovement may remain light because farmers in many areas aresold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern halfof the Midwest.    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtimefor maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducingthe weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping thespot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help Julysoybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal hasalready moved to a premium over the August through Octobermonths and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may alsomove to a July premium later this month, they added.";meal-feed

USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT     WASHINGTON, April 9 - U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mlntonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the priorweek, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, thedepartment said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largestbuyers.    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season andnet reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season werefour-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and thefour-week average, it said.    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination withpurchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.    Other significant purchasers for the current year wereMexico and Honduras, it said.    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below theprior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the majorpurchasers, the department said.    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-weekaverage. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, theNetherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset byreductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, theDepartment said.    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's levelbut nine pct below the four-week average.    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followedby Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.    Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than theprior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers. ;meal-feed
OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION    HAMBURG, Oct 20 - Oilmeal demand remained strong in theUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seenin the same months last year, with most of the rise coming insoymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose toa record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pcton the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal atseven pct, it said.    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago monthsfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediatelybut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, itestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes byOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year.

"BROOKLYN UNION<BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE<AUTHOR>    By NAILENE CHOU WIEST, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 18 - Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gasutility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result ofTransco Energy Co's <E> decision to close its pipelines totransport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.    Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in theUnited States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, ornon-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spotsupplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,analysts said.    Texas Eastern pipelines <TET>, the other competingpipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the Southclosed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union hasrelied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.     In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrsper mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gascosts four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.    Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide openaccess to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fearof accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.    Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers forgas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.    Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount ofsupplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, aBrooklyn Union official said.    Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidmost of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed throughto rate payers.    While net effect on the company will not be known forseveral months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,will end up paying more for gas, he said.    Because the closure takes place in summer months when gasdemand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would besmall, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson LufkinJenrette, said.    If the situation persists into winter heating season, highcost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.    Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco forspot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co <NCNG>,Piedmont Natural Gas Co <PNY>, will face the same high costfactor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager withend users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokeringfirm, said.    ""But these companies are not unwitting victims of thetake-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,"" he said.    Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's requestfor an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facilityfor spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.    Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas willthreaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting toalternative fuels, he said.    In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from theFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is beingnegotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.    Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gasfor them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatoryon the inventory charge, he said.    ""Cool heads will prevail,"" DLJ's Launer said, "" but it maytake a while.""       ";nat-gas

"TENNECO <TGT> TO TRANSPORT GAS ON OPEN ACCESS    HOUSTON, June 19 - Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas PipelineCo, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transportnatural gas under the open access rules of the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission, FERC.    In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transportcompany, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines alsotransport its own gas to customers.    Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co <T> rejected the FERCguidelines, saying it would not offer open access until theregulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces forgas it has bought but could not sell.    The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or paycontracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-termcontracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe ascustomers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.    Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week thatTenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines toopen-access because of the take-or-pay issue.    But Tenneco today said open access ""is one of the stepsFERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERCis moving the industry through this restructuring now, evenbefore all transitional problems are solved.""    A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposureunder the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figurefor Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines fromLouisiana and Texas up to New England.

COLUMBIA GAS <CG> SEEKS CONTRACT COST RECOVERY    CHARLESTON, W.

Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiarysaid, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice aproposal to include these costs in the company's most recentpurchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.    Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denialruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternativefiling if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing toinclude the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA orconsolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filingand permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.    The company said the alternative filing seeks to recoverabout 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas salescommodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based onrecovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,beginning April 1, 1987.    Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipelinecommodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.    The company said it orginially sought to include thesecosts in its PGA since the payments to products resulted inalmost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and werenot related to take-or-pay buyout costs.    It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-paybuyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filingunder the Natural Gas Act.    As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average pricepaid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrsper mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April1985.

SAUDI OIL RESERVES RISE DESPITE HIGHER OUTPUT    JEDDAH, June 19 - Proven oil and gas deposits in SaudiArabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, accordingto the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.    Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ftfrom 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.    Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between SaudiArabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels perday in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.    Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, asOPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapturetheir share of the market. In the process, prices collapsedfrom about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until theorganisation decided to cut production again from lastSeptember onwards.    Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.    Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightlyto 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on theofficial Saudi Press Agency.    The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in thenumber of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.    Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant wasupgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enablingit to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, thereport said.    The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned byanother state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- producedaround 750,000 bpd last year.    Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company beganoperating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnesper day, the report said.    Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.;nat-gas
JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS    TOKYO, April 8 - The Ministry of International Trade andIndustry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demandoutlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japaneseenergy demand, ministry officials said.    MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energysupplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600mln, they said.    The decision follows the emergence of structural changes inJapanese industry following the rise in the value of the yenand a decline in domestic electric power demand.    MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demandoutlook through deliberations of committee meetings of theAgency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.    They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energysupply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.    Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric powerin the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) andliquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.;nat-gas

YUGOSLAV ECONOMY WORSENED IN 1986, BANK DATA SHOWS    BELGRADE, April 13 - National Bank economic data for 1986shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation raterose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded andthe value of the dinar fell.    The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pcthigher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first threemonths of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hardcurrency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.    Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures indinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollarsbased on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.    Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with theconvertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to adeterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currencyarea rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.    Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 whileindustrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's datashowed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.    Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wageswere too high given the level of productivity.    Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of thelast quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.    Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 moneysupply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth offoreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrsabroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.    The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hardcurrencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against theSwiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar,46.2 pct.;retail
"U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER<AUTHOR>    BY Susan Zeidler, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 9 - U.S. retailers' lackluster March saleswere due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect arecovery in April.    ""Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, butunderlying business is better than the numbers indicate,"" saidBear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.     Analysts generally average the sales results of March andApril to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. Thisyear, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is threeweeks later than last year.    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates saidsales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and aseasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted5.7 pct last year.    ""The obvious question is whether these numbers indicatethat the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appearto be because liquidity and employment are rising,"" saidanalyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.    Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming inaccording to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expectedto rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.     In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticketitems were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to manyanalysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as theholiday nears.    ""Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect acontinuing strength in the housing market,"" said EdwardBrennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co <S> which reported anoverall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women'ssportswear were also excellent.    ""Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but evena modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishmentdue to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,""said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner.     J.C. Penney Co Inc <JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp <DH> wereamong the weaker performers with comparable stores salesdeclining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store andcatalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson'soverall sales rose 4.8 pct.    Penney chairman William Howell said, ""Sales continuedstrong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged fromvery active in the east to weak in the economically depressedsouthwest.""    ""Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activitywear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,but are currently hurting sales,"" said Greenstein of BearStearns.    Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter forthe decline. Edelman of Drexel said that ""Hudson had a toughercomparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.""    Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lowerthan last year.    ""Retailers are not planning for much - inventories arebeing kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but salesare coming through anyway,"" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.    Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning ofthe year.    Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle ofMay.

"LEUTWILER WANTS FIRMER MARK AGAINST SFR    BADEN, Switzerland, June 2 - Fritz Leutwiler, chairman ofBBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bankpresident, urged the National Bank to declare its intent ofachieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.    In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, ""A graduallyrising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would bedesirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and withregard to sustaining Swiss industry.""    ""Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank ofissue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect,"" hesaid.    Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss centralbank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank'starget of monetary stability.    ""Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, haveto be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetarypolicy,"" he told shareholders. ""Realistically there is in fact nopersuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20pct lower than the Swiss.""    A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark andSwiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over along period of time.    The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influenceindividual parities separately.    Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not supportthe value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other centralbanks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.    ""I would be the last to recommend that. The key to astronger dollar lies in the United States itself,"" Leutwilersaid.";dmk
"LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nationsstill comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilizecurrencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at theweekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lowerrange for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank ofJapan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.    ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, andanyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret itlater on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk thedollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, henoted.    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved inmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Wouldnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollaragainst the mark or the yen.    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and141.35 yen.    ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higherinterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but thisdoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic frameworkof the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid anyfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not onlyhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debtproblem.    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise theirinterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond marketsfurther, the monetary officials said.    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declinedto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a furtherdecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationaryexpectations in the U.S.    ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvreagreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry officialsaid.    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday thatWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of WestGermany's increase in short-term interest rates.    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollardecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in theaccord, foreign exchange dealers said.    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additionalstatement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" andthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, thedealers said.    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day inTokyo currency markets.    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguisedpressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rateshigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,or international economic policy coordination.    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other'seconomic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" topersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateralsurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West Germanpolicy so openly,"" the ministry official said.    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policyshould thus be regarded as a process of healthy policycoordination and not as any indication of a possible collapseof the Louvre agreement, the official said.    He also said Japan has not received any specific requestfrom the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-termmoney rates have been edging higher.    ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not takingpolicy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal raterise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" headded.";dmk
"DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY<AUTHOR>    By Marcel Michelson, Reuters</AUTHOR>    AMSTERDAM, June 1 - A cut of about half a percentage pointin Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, althougheconomists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and widepremiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advancesrate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped itsrepurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.    That rate has remained in force, just holding above thefive pct official secured loans rate which governs commercialbank borrowings.    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West Germanrepo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate tothree pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered moneymarket rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loansrate on lending under its three month credit quota.    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and FinanceMinistry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said hewould follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the FinanceMinistry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billionguilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pctfor an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a differencebetween the secured loans rate which applies to lending underthe credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which addextra liquidity to the money market.    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move tofurther lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts wouldresult in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around itsparity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673guilders per 100 marks.    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a levelthat would not permit a change in the interest ratedifferential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealerssaid.    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German andDutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, hesaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflationexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest ratesin the longer term.    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,or even negative, while the latest official economic forecastspoint to a falling rate of economic growth.    ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreementnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""the ABN economist said.    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct inJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run totwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in thesecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buyingspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall belowfive pct.    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct inthe money market.";dmk

THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER    BANGKOK, April 8 - Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion ayear ago, the Business Economics Department said.    It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion bahtfrom 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate thisyear resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materialsand semi-finished products.    The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in thefirst quarter due to lower oil prices.    The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6billion baht from 56.6 billion.    Export growth was smaller than expected due to lowerearnings from many key commodities including rice whoseearnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26pct and canned pineapples seven pct.    Products registering high export growth were jewellery up64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.;grain
BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT    WASHINGTON, April 9 - Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasonsfor the decline are expected reduced government support priceand good summer crop harvests.;grain

"SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - Recent announcements from Moscow ofnext year's grain production targets indicate that the Sovietsare estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,Agriculture Department analysts said.    USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, butsome earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.    Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst ofSoviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article inIzvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.""    ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.       In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figurepublished in a Soviet economic journal this month.    USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects arange of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.    Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvestprogress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.    While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agricultureofficial Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would beas good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.    A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mlntonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems wouldbring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.";grain
"SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA    WASHINGTON, April 9 - The U.S. Agriculture Departmentincreased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the SovietUnion to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.    In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, theUSDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated becauseSoviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the lastmonth.    USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising""because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.    All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,USDA said.    Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnesmiscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.    USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop sufferedthrough a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.    The severe winter ""is believed to have resulted in aboveaverage winter-kill,"" USDA said.    Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter lossesmaybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buyinggrain recently.

JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT    TOKYO, June 18 - Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier.

U.S. URGES JAPAN TO OPEN FARM MARKET FURTHER    TOKYO, April 17 - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lynghas asked Japan to open its farm market further to helpWashington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionistpressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.    Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's EconomicAffairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture MinisterMutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would helpJapan as well as the United States.    The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan byLyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.    However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan wasalready the world's largest grain importer.    Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain anddepended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its foodrequirements in 1985.    Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farmproducts named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as onbeef, citrus products and rice.    Kato said Japan will maintain its current level ofself-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus ricebecause potential production is higher than domestic demand.    The world farm market suffers from surpluses because ofrising production by exporting countries, he added.    Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm productoutput with expensive programs, Maki said.

"AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS    MELBOURNE, April 13 - Australia could lose valuable wheatmarkets through lack of availability if plantings for thecoming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, AustralianWheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.    ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings provetrue, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of itsvaluable markets,"" he said in a statement.    Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWBspokesman said there was a general industry feeling thatfarmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cutback plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.    However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would becut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers werefacing enormous financial pressures.    He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mlnhectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and plantingintentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.    If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut inplantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developedwith much time and effort, it may have great difficulty sellingwheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.    ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheatunderstand a decrease in production due to drought but theywill have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision todecrease production,"" Condon said.    ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major exportincome earner, governments and government authorities will needto closely examine ways of contributing to the continuingviability of the wheat industry,"" he added.    Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.";grain

"NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - The Soviets have not indicated anurgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikelythat such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summitexpected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng told Reuters.    In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he didnot know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheatsubsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.    ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me thatthere's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (awheat subsidy).""    When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Sovietsummit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""    The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal toMoscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate fordiscussion at a summit.    ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or theChairman would get into specific negotiations or discussionsabout,"" Lyng said.    ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary foragriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat wasnot something that would be discussed with the President of theUnited States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.    Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some majorproducing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and thestill unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any finaldecision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.    The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreementwill be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but theAgriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of thelong-standing agreement.    ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets havefailed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We wouldlove to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""    When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted fromthe agreement, Lyng said, ""I don't know. It certainly hasn'tbeen what we had hoped it would be. For three years runningthey've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was anagreement.""";grain

"ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE    LUSAKA, April 8 - The Zambian government has no immediateplans to follow last week's increase in the producer price ofmaize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, anofficial of the ruling party said.    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price forrefined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots inwhich at least 15 people died.    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda laterrevoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail priceincrease, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,a practice discouraged by the IMF.    ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels ofmeal.

However, in general plant development was at least threeweeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions variedgreatly by regions, the report said.

"SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS<AUTHOR>    By Tony Barber</AUTHOR>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - The Soviet Union outlined its economictargets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improvestandards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.    Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Sovietindustrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from aplanned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against aplanned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures theoutput of a country's goods and services.    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes ofgrain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscowproduced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedmachine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization isessential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively onworld markets.    ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987compared with the same period last year.    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase plannedfor the industry for the whole of 1988.    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recentmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended toa large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources,"" he said.    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet thatdefense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the samefigure as was announced last year.    Western governments view official Soviet estimates fordefense spending as highly understated, but say the real figureis hard to calculate because Soviet military industries areintertwined with the civilian economy.    Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spendingnext year on medical services, education, pensions and socialinsurance schemes.";grain

"SENATOR DEFENDS U.S. MANDATORY FARM CONTROL BILL    WASHINGTON, June 18 - Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended hiscontroversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether theyapprove of the proposal.    The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs perbushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs forsoybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls onplanted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrsfor wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.    Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world marketsharing cartel with the European Community and other exportingnations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during thefirst of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearingsexamining farm programs.    Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his""Family Farm Act.""    -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm incomeand reduce government spending on agriculture.    -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would notruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but wouldincrease overall revenue from exports.    This would be done by seeking agreement among majorexporting countries including the European Community on marketsharing at agreed high prices.    Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearingthat such a grain export cartel is not workable.    -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supportswould be passed onto consumers, but he said high food pricesstem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than fromhigh farm product prices.    Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns onequity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pctMonfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pctQuaker Oats.    -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill wouldbe the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.    He said as a transition to the higher prices, he wouldallow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.grain stocks for three years.    Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said.    -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farmparticipation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the currentfarm program. He said farmers now must participate in farmprograms in order to receive credit for planting and to protectfarm income.";grain

BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS    WASHINGTON, June 18 - U.S. House and Senate budgetnegotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reachedyesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spendingon agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from thefarm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for atotal of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculturecommittees with difficult choices on how to make changes inagriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targetswithout jeopardizing popular support payments, seniorCongressional aides told Reuters.    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to findthe budget savings.    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grainssubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheatand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrsand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza hassaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely tobe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers anda strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who saidfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other majorgrain export competitors and would not achieve the budgetsavings Glickman claims.    Another area where Glickman and other have said budgetsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,ARP, levels for wheat and corn.    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong standwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 cropwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Mostcommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.    Congressional sources said the only way to achievesignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boostthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source saidsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen asunfair to one commodity.    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is mostlikely to eventually look for budget savings are sometightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billionbut not enough, they said.    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculturecommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut onall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including pricesupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to theGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm BureauFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.;grain

BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS    SAO PAULO, April 8 - Storage problems with Brazil's recordgrain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mlntonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of thisyear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable inharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storageproblems.    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,theoretically sufficient for the crop.    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badlydistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity.    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said.    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crophas been evident from television reports, which have shownenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.;grain
ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT    LUSAKA, June 1 - The Zambian government today announcedminor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its neweconomic strategy, while police and troops patrolled thenorthern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.    However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,were not affected by the cuts and many people said this couldprovoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected moresweeping reductions.    Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with thesmall extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct onitems such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.    Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone saidgovernment forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.    In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no signof troops or police reinforcements on the streets.    President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to takeaccount of lower import costs following the revaluation of thekwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.    The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economicstrategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerityprogram.    Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs ofunemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatileregion to take action against shops that did not reduce theirprices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed inthe Copperbelt during food riots last December after thegovernment tried to lift maize subsidies.;grain

"INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS    JAKARTA, June 18 - Indonesia rejected World Bankrecommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, asthe country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak.""    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of ""over-production and price interventionin the developed nations.""";grain

As a result there were a series of baking seminars as wellas the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millersand convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.    The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegalremain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market thathad been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly Frenchwheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.;grain

"EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - The European Community (EC) agreed atrade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the countryfollowing the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, ECofficials said.    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentinawill gain additional trading rights on a series of productsincluding meat, fish and cereals by-products.    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals withCanada and Japan and are due to study these again, theofficials said.    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of ECstates after West Germany withdrew objections to increasedquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,saying that the main dispute was over sales of cerealssubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, theofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade).    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership.    Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on thefish dispute with Canada.    Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The ECclaims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group hasimproved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfiedwith Japanese offers of compensation.    Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems oncitrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for someother farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwearand to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.    EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq toldjournalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese)concessions were not enough.""    ""We hope that there will be an improvement,"" he said.";grain

AGENCY HEAD SAYS JAPAN SHOULD CUT RICE PRICE    TOKYO, June 19 - The government should cut its consumerrice price if the official producer price is reduced nextmonth, Tetsuo Kondo, director general of the government'sEconomic Planning Agency (EPA), told reporters.    Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers shouldreceive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming dueto the strong yen and lower oil prices.    Agriculture Ministry sources said the producer rice pricepaid to rice farmers would be cut after discussions by the RicePrice Council, an advisory body to the ministry, on July 1 and2. The consumer rice price is usually set in December.;grain

"INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM IDEAS    JAKARTA, June 18 - Indonesia rejected World Bankrecommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, asthe country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.    Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarksdistributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations metat The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bankfor this free trade, open economy view is weak.""    The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages thelargest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agriculturalgrowth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.    The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peakedand the subsidies are a waste of money.    Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and providesan income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies wereneeded to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well asassisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.    Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmersshould be free to choose their own crops, but he said thegovernment would continue to maintain production targets for""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.    The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia'sdrive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are doublethe world average because of inefficiencies, and the countrywould save money by importing the commodity.    However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the needto save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugarindustry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.    He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in theagricultural sector were needed to help domestic industrydevelop and because of ""over-production and price interventionin the developed nations.""";grain
FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years.;grain

ITALIAN BARLEY CROP REPORTED IN GOOD CONDITION    ROME, June 2 - Italy's barley crop is generally in goodcondition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, theagricultural marketing information and research board Irvamsaid.    First consignments were expected to be available aroundmid-June.    Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods ofsunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,which was expected to lose a large part of its barley cropbecause of extreme dryness.

"FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT, GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987    ROME, April 9 - The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely tofall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.    FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total worldgrain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the SovietUnion, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.    World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast torise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening theimpact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenlydistributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.    ""Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for manydeveloping countries, particularly in Africa, depend cruciallyon the outcome of this year's harvests,"" FAO said.    FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated ata record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than lastseason and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.    FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revisedupwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood ofsubstantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.";grain
"PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS    ISLAMABAD, June 29 - Pakistani government allowed freercotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimedat narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech the government had also decided to allowduty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industrymore competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export ofPakistani products.       Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s.    But Haq said now the private sector would also exportcotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets along-standing demand of the local traders.    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed tobring down prices and help the local ancillary industriescompete effectively in the world market, he said.       Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years butreviewed every year.    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcingtrade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it wouldenable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over alonger period.    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been providedfor the export of engineering goods to selected third worldcountries on soft credit terms.       Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 percent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.    He said the government policy was to rationalise andstreamline import controls.    ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, localindustry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" hesaid. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goodsproduced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave riseto smuggling and hampering of exports.""       He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freedfrom import restrictions.    Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely fromremittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in theGulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after thedrop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of abalance of payments crisis for Pakistan.";grain
"U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER    WASHINGTON, June 29 - Prospects appear slim for a summermeeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the twocountries enter the final year of their bilateral grainsagreement, Agriculture Department officials said.    The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of theagreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed upto last February. However, any delay this year should notendanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extendsthrough September, 1988, USDA officials said.

"JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 8 - Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market,"" he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.

"U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS<AUTHOR>    by Keith Leighty, Reuters</AUTHOR>    CHICAGO, April 9 - Commodities from gold to grains tocotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as lossesin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears ofinflation and economic instability.    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York.    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets.    ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""Ifthey do, it's not evident.""    ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be.    ""One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.    ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening,"" he said.    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick.    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains.    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand.    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher.    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They saidhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals.";grain

The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'Association and the National Union of Agricultural and CerealCooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports orend-of-season stocks.    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mlnwas not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.

This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry ofAgriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectaresagainst 4.61 mln in 1986/87.

""There is going to be more rain for the next two, threedays,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal toabove normal moisture this week.""    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southernMinnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in easternNebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend butwere receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio withthudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.    ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, apretty good rain,"" Mohler said.    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparkingan early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board ofTrade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.

"INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88    NEW DELHI, April 9 - India's national foodgrain target hasbeen fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchangedfrom the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in itsannual report for 1986/87.    Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterologicalsub-divisions of the country.    The report gave the targets for various crops withestimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grainsincluding sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).    Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it waspossible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifyinggrowing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.    The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along withgreater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement infertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, addingtotal foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4mln.   India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnesof foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-yeardevelopment plan ending March 31, 1990.    Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gapof 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining threeyears of the plan by increasing grain output annually by morethan nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only withgood weather, the report said.    ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water(irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread ofimproved technology including timely use of inputs (farmmaterials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to bevigrously pursued,"" it said.";grain

CHINA PROVINCE BECOMES GRAIN IMPORTER    PEKING, June 1 - The south China province of Guangdong isimporting millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas andother parts of China because farmers have switched from grainto more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.    The official magazine said the province's grain area fellto 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of atotal farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.    Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in partto supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, themagazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.    The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of nationalfarmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct underother crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.    It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity andlow productivity make grain the least profitable farmcommodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuanfrom cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.

"BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING    SAN FRANCISCO, June 18 - A trade-led boom in the U.S. isunlikely this year or next because growth in net exports willmerely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending andother sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in itslatest economic report.    Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending willcontribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.    ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said.    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.    The report was released before the Commerce Departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before.    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.    ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said.    Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on animprovement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes onthe rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" headded.";income

YUGOSLAV ECONOMY WORSENED IN 1986, BANK DATA SHOWS    BELGRADE, April 13 - National Bank economic data for 1986shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation raterose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded andthe value of the dinar fell.    The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pcthigher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first threemonths of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hardcurrency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.    Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures indinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollarsbased on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.    Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with theconvertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to adeterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currencyarea rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.    Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 whileindustrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's datashowed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.    Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wageswere too high given the level of productivity.    Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of thelast quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.    Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 moneysupply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9billion dinars.

"U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, June 18 - Today's U.K. Economic data have pushedthe chances of another base lending rate cut from the currentnine pct further into the distance, analysts said.    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturingproduction data showed that the economy is still strong anddoes not need a fillip from lower rates.    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,taken together with higher than expected bank lending and moneysupply growth, revived inflation worries and monetaristarguments against easier credit, they said.    ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed backall the while. The strength of the economy and broad moneygrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the nearterm,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday'smortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societiessaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.Rates.    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week thata post-general election cut was imminent, supported by suchoptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise whichmirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling'sstrength.    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasmabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidlyreplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlyingaverage earnings in April, dealers said.    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lendingrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bankof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offsetthe impact on domestic money supply of its currentintervention.    ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.    ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a verygood state indeed,"" Skeoch said.    ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationarypressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost riseswere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year toApril, and it was these costs rather than average earningswhich were potentially inflationary, he added.    ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a majorproblem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worriedabout the funding implications of recent intervention.    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assetsearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes thatthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, nowlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities tryto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort GrievesonSecurities, said any fresh sterling strength would stilltrigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signalhigher inflation this year.

"ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY<AUTHOR>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</AUTHOR>    HOUSTON, April 8 - Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct willpropel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to recordprofits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,major company executives predicted.    This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and anindustrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAFCorp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firmsto aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.    Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, theKentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping formoney-making petrochemical businesses to buy.    ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" saidPaul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding,""There's no major plant capacity being added around the worldnow. The whole game is bringing out new products and improvingthe old ones.""    Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot ofpaints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.    U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hikeproduct prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demandfor some products such as styrene could push profit margins upby as much as 300 pct, he said.    Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers inHouston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earnedlast year and predicted it would have the best year in itshistory.    In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barreland chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entirechemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""Oreffice said.    GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemicalindustry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billiondlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.    The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemicalindustry has been brought about by a combination of luck andplanning, said Pace's John Dosher.    Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocksdramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollarwas weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boostU.S. chemical exports.    Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance hasbeen the gradual market absorption of the extra chemicalmanufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producersin the early 1980s.    Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturershave embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring programto mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminateunrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry offriendly and hostile takeover attempts.    GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquireUnion Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrsfor Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plasticsand chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizerbusinesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.    But some experts worry that the chemical industry may beheaded for trouble if companies continue turning their back onthe manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such asethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals thatare custom-designed for a small group of buyers.    ""Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent thepast two or three years trying to get out of the commoditychemical business in reaction to how badly the market haddeteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventuallykill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the nichemarket."" Some top chemical executives share the concern.    ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from gettingcarried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heymancautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may beill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.""    Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by theSterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.    Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyoutof Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plantsalong the Texas Gulf Coast.    The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals thatare the building blocks of specialty products.    ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be aglamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demandis expected to grow by about three pct annually.    Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, saidchemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand forplastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, woodand steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemicalbusiness could last as long as four or five years, provided theU.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.";pet-chem

""We are looking at more options to acquire more reservesrather than just exploration,"" Conger said adding, ""the move toconsider acquisitions represents a change in the company'sacquisitions policy.""    Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs whichhave not been drawn on today and could be used to finance anacquisition, he said.    Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will beabout the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger saidexploration for precious metals may be slightly higher thanlast year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gasexploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6pct.    Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production aboutthe same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.

"U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS<AUTHOR>    by Keith Leighty, Reuters</AUTHOR>    CHICAGO, April 9 - Commodities from gold to grains tocotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as lossesin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears ofinflation and economic instability.    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York.    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets.    ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""Ifthey do, it's not evident.""    ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be.    ""One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.    ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening,"" he said.    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick.    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains.    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand.    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher.    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They saidhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals.";gold

The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet andprepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, hesaid.     The three locals cover about 2,600 production andmaintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley,B.C. lead-zinc mine.     Output at both sites has been shut down since theproduction and maintenance workers, along with about 600 officeand technical workers, went on strike May nine.          The two Steelworkers locals representing the office andtechnical workers have not negotiated since May 21.     The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeire, whichmeans the company may not be able to honor contracts forproducts from the smelter and mine.    Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all ofwhich expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.            The union had requested a three pct wage increase in eachyear of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for athree-year contract and some loosening of the rules on jobclassifications.     The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons oflead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 mileseast of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,most for processing at the Trail smelter.

"U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 13 - Major U.S. banks may lift primelending rates again within days due to recent increases intheir borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve isnudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.    In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, mostbanks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their owncost of money. That spread has narrowed again.    ""A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,""said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.    Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct isjustified because the spread between banks' cost of funds andthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of apercentage point.    He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentagepoints since last October until it fell below one point andtriggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.    ""We could easily have another prime rate increase as soonas this week,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.    ""We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in thenear future,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.    ""Based on the spread between the prime rate and fundingcosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,""said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the primebecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loandemand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintainrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates.    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures liftshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. Hesaid ""if there is widespread belief money market rates willstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.""    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep adollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollarfell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traderssaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way tostabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actionson Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said ""it has becomeclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressurein the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.""    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interestrates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculationthat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in themarket than most economists had expected.    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in smallamounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreementswith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one anotherhigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pcttoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlrround of customer repurchase agreements.    ""The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it isoffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,""said Jones of Lanston.    ""The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on theneed to defend the dollar,"" Jones said. He believes it ismerely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have amajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policyovertly at some point.""    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates bybecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, withinfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct mightwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts tofurther aid the dollar.    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime ratemay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.    ""The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tighteningpolicy to defend the dollar,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp. Hesaid tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressuresabate will show whether or not it is firming policy.  ";money-fx
"TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY<AUTHOR>    By Chen Chien-Kuo, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TAIPEI, June 19 - Recent government moves to curb capitalinflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan'sforeign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollaragainst the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.    Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters thereserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past twoweeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against theU.S. Dollar.    Chang said, ""The pace of increase in our reserves is muchslower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.""He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surpluswith the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.Dlrs a month between January and May.    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan andWest Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.    On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings oflocal and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bankpurchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90pct of the value of a contract.    Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures haddrastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange toimporters and exporters.    They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollartransactions showed a drastic decline with some banksregistering a fall of up to 30 pct.    Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised againstthe U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanesecents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of fiveto eight cents in May.    The bank dealers said the central bank, which hadpreviously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercialdemand.    They said they expected the government to keep the localdollar stable in the near term to give breathing space tobusinesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise ofmore than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar sinceSeptember 1985.    The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,unchanged from yesterday.    Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,""It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflowis quite successful.""    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slowerrise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure fromWashington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.    Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayedimports of machinery and production equipment because ofexchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange ratewould help boost imports, particularly from the United States.";money-fx
"LEUTWILER WANTS FIRMER MARK AGAINST SFR    BADEN, Switzerland, June 2 - Fritz Leutwiler, chairman ofBBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bankpresident, urged the National Bank to declare its intent ofachieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.    In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, ""A graduallyrising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would bedesirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and withregard to sustaining Swiss industry.""    ""Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank ofissue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect,"" hesaid.    Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss centralbank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank'starget of monetary stability.    ""Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, haveto be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetarypolicy,"" he told shareholders. ""Realistically there is in fact nopersuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20pct lower than the Swiss.""    A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark andSwiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over along period of time.    The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influenceindividual parities separately.    Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not supportthe value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other centralbanks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.    ""I would be the last to recommend that. The key to astronger dollar lies in the United States itself,"" Leutwilersaid.";money-fx

"GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn</AUTHOR>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany'scentral bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg arenormally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt thecentral bank's independence.    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over acontroversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes ofthe country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt lastThursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs andinterest rates    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl'scriticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive placefor foreign investors.    ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank andFinance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreigninvestors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who askednot to be identified.    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financialpolicy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship tosteer the economy through a particularly difficult time.    ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will resultin things getting back to normal again after a period of illfeeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pctwithholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds ina market already reeling from rising interest rates at home andabroad.    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way thefinance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting theBundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflictingdetails to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been underextraordinary pressures lately.    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by hisdeputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fightinflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he hadpursued so far this year to promote currency stability.    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more likeSchlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has beenwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supplygrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbankcouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent hisviews, bankers said.    ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank'sPfister.    ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is notentirely his own,"" said another economist.    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the markand hurting West German exporters.    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since theBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary JamesBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany tostimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a roundof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult forStoltenberg than he had bargained for.    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly votedmost popular government politician last year, had to faceresistance from local barons in the government coalitionparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising4.3 billion marks.    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it willpush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs thegovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political rowwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington lastmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state ofSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign afterallegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavylosses for the CDU in state elections.    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva lastweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the moreremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, andwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier thisyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition governmentgave Poehl another eight-year term.    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said hehoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he wasnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating theBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.";money-fx

"VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS    PANAMA CITY, June 1 - Venezuela's central bank has orderedVenezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchangeoperations with brokers based outside the country, according toa copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.    The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, haseffectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela'svolatile currency market.    The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos HernandezDelfino, manager of the bank's department of internationaloperations.    The telex said the restriction on business with foreignbrokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreignexchange houses from selling dollars or other foreigncurrencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.    In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has deniedrumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls toprop up the weakening bolivar.    But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a defacto currency control. ""It is definitely a control in the sensethat there's no longer complete freedom to operate,"" one brokerhere said.    ""Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the directionis towards complete control,"" the broker said.    The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all hisVenezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him sincethe central bank issued the telex and followed it up withtelephone calls.    He said that before the restriction was imposed the volumeof his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrsa day. ""It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,"" hesaid.    The broker said he saw no logical explanation for theprohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediarybetween Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.    ""We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that'sridiculous,"" he said. ""They've been on a rampage againstforeigners.""    The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's centralbank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchangebusiness outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pctreserve requirement.    In February, the central bank also prohibited trading inbolivar futures, the broker said.    ""We used to have a forward market,"" he said. ""For a smallcurrency it was miraculous.""    He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current rangeof 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly runningout of foreign reserves to support the currency on the freemarket.";money-fx

"LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS<AUTHOR>    By Kunio Inoue</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nationsstill comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilizecurrencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.    And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at theweekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lowerrange for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank ofJapan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.    ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, andanyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret itlater on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.    The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk thedollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, henoted.    A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved inmonetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Wouldnever attempt to lower the reference range for the dollaragainst the mark or the yen.    The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.    The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and141.35 yen.    ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higherinterest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but thisdoes not represent its readiness to scrap the basic frameworkof the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.    He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid anyfurther rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not onlyhurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debtproblem.    Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise theirinterest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond marketsfurther, the monetary officials said.    Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declinedto be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a furtherdecline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationaryexpectations in the U.S.    ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvreagreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry officialsaid.    Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday thatWashington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of WestGermany's increase in short-term interest rates.    The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollardecline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in theaccord, foreign exchange dealers said.    But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additionalstatement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" andthis caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, thedealers said.    Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day inTokyo currency markets.    The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguisedpressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rateshigher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,or international economic policy coordination.    The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other'seconomic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" topersuade others to change their policies to a desired course,they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateralsurveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West Germanpolicy so openly,"" the ministry official said.    The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policyshould thus be regarded as a process of healthy policycoordination and not as any indication of a possible collapseof the Louvre agreement, the official said.    He also said Japan has not received any specific requestfrom the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-termmoney rates have been edging higher.    ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not takingpolicy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal raterise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" headded.";money-fx

"TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS<AUTHOR>    By Guy Collins</AUTHOR>    PARIS, Oct 19 - The Louvre accord on currency stability,which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets sincelast February, appeared in serious danger today as atransatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came tothe boil, foreign exchange dealers said.    But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock andbond markets plunged, officials in the major industrialcountries played down the dispute as a bilateral problembetween the United States and West Germany and insisted thatthe currency pact was still alive.    U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the marketfears when he attacked the rise in West German short-terminterest rates. ""That's not in keeping with the spirit of whatwe agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,""Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He wasreferring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Groupof Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed thepact.    Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who bothhave large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economicgrowth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.    However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvreagreement was still operative, the West German interest ratemove would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.    ""The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker thathe's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all betsare off in terms of currency cooperation,"" Chris Johns, currencyanalyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.    But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguineview, telling Reuters that ""the exchange market is apparentlyreacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Bakercomment will regret it later on.""    French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted theLouvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers torespond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for ""a faithfuland firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to theLouvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""    Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the BritishTreasury commented on the row.    But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despiteU.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, ""this doesnot represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of theLouvre Accord.""    In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executiveof West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said thatfollowing recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.Was still committed to the accord.    In a move which the market interpreted as a possiblegesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-termliquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct onMonday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injectedmedium-term liquidity last week.

"ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - An income tax surcharge and capitalgains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation ofthe N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and theBank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed torestore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut bycurrent government policies.    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turnwould lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 couldbe much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as apercentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase wasprobably unavoidable, Bayliss said.    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pctvalue-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationaryimpact of a currency depreciation.    The government had failed to bring inflation down despitelower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year toend-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflationpolicies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates andinsufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Baylisssaid. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debtand debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.    ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems aregoing to take much longer to solve than was originally thoughtis soundly based -- primarily because the government'smacro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,"" Bayliss said.";money-fx

"NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE    WELLINGTON, June 18 - Analysts said they were surprised atthe government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus forfiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policystatements and positive for the economy.    Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplusfor the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrsagainst a 1.95 billion deficit last year.    Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surpluswas even more positive than the most bullish analysts'forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.    Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reutersbefore the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.    The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond andthe foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despitelower interest rates, as overseas investors became moreconfident about investing in New Zealand, he said.    However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, sayingthe local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and willmove lower.    The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in afterhours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budgetrelease.    Analysts said the budget was also positive for the sharemarket, despite an increase in the contribution of companytaxation to revenue figures.    One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplusannouncement could push the share market up by 50 pointstomorrow.    The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with acontinuation of existing policies, and the absence oftraditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positivelyby overseas investors, another said.    But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-taxavoidance measures could damage some sectors of the sharemarket, particularly multi-national companies.    The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. Therequirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mlnN.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.    Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable andthere appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, anothereconomist said.

"POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</AUTHOR>    FRANKFURT, June 2 - For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl isthe scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who hasplayed a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny forthe last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of themark.    President of the powerful and independent West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have hiscontract renewed for another eight years when it expires at theend of this year, government officials say.    (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)    But no official announcement has yet been made, raisingeyebrows in West Germany's business community.    The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in topministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now inopposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.    There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohlwould try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his ownChristian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has workedclosely and successfully with Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.    Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from PaulVolcker of the United States, enjoys a strong internationalreputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.    Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlookPoehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat ChancellorWilly Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he wasFinance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, asChancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.    In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against thedollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern ofthe Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institutionwhich has doggedly pursued monetary policies to preventinflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two boutsof galloping inflation this century.    But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, andinflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safeto relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on thedangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.    ""I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise thedollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for theBundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the markwould endanger the economy in West Germany,"" he told businessjournalists in Frankfurt recently.    Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says thatPoehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.    ""Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does notfocus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the externaleconomy,"" she said.    An economist at a German bank, who declined to beidentified, said ""If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it willcertainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not sorigidly oriented towards money supply.""    One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been topersuade the United States to stop ""talking down"" the dollar. ForPoehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was thatthe United States agreed to join efforts to stabilisecurrencies.    The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currencydealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But infact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.    ""This is because the markets know - or perhaps because theydon't know - what the central banks can do,"" Poehl says ofintervention in currency markets which can quickly turn ratesround, making a speculator's position worthless.    Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalistin the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.    A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes overa glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.    He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football andplay golf.    Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitutefor correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.    ""But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amountif you strike at the right moment,"" he said. Bundesbank dealersare very professional and skilled. ""They've burnt the fingers ofmany people,"" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.";money-fx

"BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</AUTHOR>    FRANKFURT, June 2 - The Bundesbank is unlikely to changecredit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursdayfor its last session before the Venice summit, bankingeconomists and money market dealers said.    The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last monthby cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and isunlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest ratesin the near future, they said.    The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting willbe followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.    But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference wasusually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, anddid not necessarily herald any policy moves.    Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said todaythere was no reason to cut interest rates because money supplygrowth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar wasstable against the mark.    Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank hasopened a representative office, that the West German economywas now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.    Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold ina 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after theBundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at aminimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.    ""They have set this signal and indicated they could maybelower market rates even further, but not with the discount orLombard,"" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, saidGerman rates were among the lowest in industrial countries andaround historical lows for West Germany.    A further cut in rates would have little impact on theeconomy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.    The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a moveon interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.""The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,"" he said.    A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them inline with the new structure of money market rates since lastmonth, would have little practical significance, dealers said.    The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted adiplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.    But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made itclear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere ""eyewash.""    Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government tocut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetarypolicy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.    But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced taxcuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budgetdeficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.    ""The Bonn government will be in a very weak position inVenice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,""said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.    Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen beforeVenice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. ""But Idon't expect any convincing measures,"" he said.    Money market dealers noted that call money continued tonormalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterdayand as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up bymonth-end distortions.    Call money could come under upwards pressure later thismonth because of a major round of tax payments by banks onbehalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.    Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate fundstomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.    But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank wouldallocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would notrepresent a tightening of policy, however.    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocatesat the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a fullallocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likelyto lift restrictions on private use of the European CurrencyUnit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcementon this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of theSaarland bordering France, and was twice under Frenchoccupation this century.    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to comethis week, as a number of technical and legal matters had stillto be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would betreated for minimum reserve purposes.";money-fx

"FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 18 - New U.S. Banking data suggest theFederal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady pathand is not signalling any imminent change of course, economistssaid.    But they also said that if money supply growth remainsweak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 declinesuggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen itscredit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetarypolicy.    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced aforecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to adecline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrsto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 forthe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply hasfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,economists said.    ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivanof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator ofeconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concernedthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growthin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seenas better gauges of economic growth.    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, bothmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.    ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current openmarket position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the endof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.""    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowingsof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement periodwere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed hadtargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-daynet miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higherborrowings target would probably have been reached.    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness inauto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices hashelped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.    ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fedeasing at some point,"" he said.    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay littleattention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number ofyears since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in theeconomy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy isfalling apart and the Fed should ease.""    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be aprerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetarypolicy.    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term ratesfor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar andhigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and chokeoff econmomic growth.    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since lateApril. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents afundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this givesthem more room to ease,"" he said.";money-fx
"VENEZUELA LOWERS EXCHANGE RATE FOR OIL EARNINGS    CARACAS, June 29 - Venezuela's cabinet approved a newexchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.    Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that themeasure is ""fundamental to conserving the economic and financialstrength of the petroleum industry.""     He said the new exchange rate, which goes before thecentral bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the stateoil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve itsproblem of working capital and implement investment plans,estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say whenthe measure would become effective.   Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earningsto the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreignexchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.   The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domesticgoods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added thatit would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase moregovernment debt bonds.                            PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars atthe start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trustfund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed ingovernment bonds.

"TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE    TAIPEI, June 2 - Taiwan's central bank announced that asfrom today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of localand foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached atthe end of May.    The central bank's statement added that the measure wouldbe effective until the end of July.    Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow offoreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. Theyadded that the move, which sparked a record single day plungeof the local stock market, would limit their ability to lendforeign exchange to importers and exporters.    Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banksreached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,according to official statistics.    Last week the central bank said that from today it wouldreduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the movewas needed because of ""distortions"" in the foreign exchangemarket.    Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbankmarket to avoid exchange rate losses.    Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in Mayreached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9billion in April.    All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be convertedinto local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of boomingexports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct inthe year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.    In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions onremittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals toTaiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.    Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value ofthe local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs ofspeculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It hasflowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..    Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.    Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise theforeign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs oncapital outflows. The central bank has said the controls willbe dropped by the end of July or early August.    Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement causedjitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavypurchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank soldabout 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.    Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points toclose at 1,803.08.";money-fx

"BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE    FRANKFURT, April 9 - The Bundesbank sees no current reasonto change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesingertold Reuters in a telephone interview.    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarksyesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and WestBerlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealerssaid, revived some speculation that German interest rate cutsmay once again be under discussion.    Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of histwo central bank council colleagues.    But he added that the last central bank council meeting onApril 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of""subdued optimism,"" particularly influenced by the news broughtby several state central bank presidents.    ""Much is going better than the impression gained by thepublic from the January figures, which have been in themeantime superseded,"" he said.    German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after adecline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9pct after they had been unchanged in December.    Bank economists said that the two together showed theeconomy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarterof 1987.    Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, asteady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/markrate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl OttoPoehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMFmeeting.    Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rateson repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchasetender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, ""Since the centralbank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14days, this is hardly probable.""

"TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - As official Washington sought torestore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Streetcollapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire fromcritics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank forboosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of aninternational accord to stabilize currency values.    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, wasamong those who said the treasury secretary's statements helpedspur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investorsthink that a clash between the two major economic powers woulddamage the world economy.    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""Ithink the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, Ithink, was partly due to statements that have been made bysenior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was adispute that should never have happened, he added.    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at ahastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the UnitedStates on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip toScandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""Histiming could not have been worse.""    One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actuallythought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smackthe dollar down would work. That doesn't show muchunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship.""    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn marchtoward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.    ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but ifyou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financialmarkets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca ofNikko Securities International in New York.    ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, somaking him responsible for it was a little like killing themessenger,"" he said.    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governmentsmade it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced togetherin Paris in February, was still in effect.    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might bea prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar tothe late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crashwiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy aboutBonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep theglobal recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interestrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59thmonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economicexpansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a hugemarket for debtor country exports.    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worriedthat the Republican party might face next year's presidentialelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badlytarnished.    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debtcrisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that hasalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.    ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on theeconomy, and it's important that the psychology turn aroundquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, andeventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,""former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in atelevision interview.    In many ways, the official response was mild.    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,with President Reagan speaking for most people by admittingthat he was ""puzzled.""    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediatelyreturned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developmentsand, presumably, their political impact.    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status inWashington will diminish because of the market fall.    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll becauseof the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator LloydBentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late tobe doing that...You have an administration that's taken theattitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't dothat.""";money-fx

"U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 9 - Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financialmarkets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar'swake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology thatis likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's declineas the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fellsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.    But that confidence is now cracking as the financialmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker'soften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.    ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollarfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" saidDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washingtonfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have acredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, shortof further depreciation of the dollar.    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amidworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scareaway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spikein interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average downby 33 points to 2339.    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called themarkets' instability frightening. He believes economicfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""onceyou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.""    ""There's a stark possibility that you could get adestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest ratesand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.""    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economicsin Washington, has been warning for a long time that thecontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.    ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... Butthe agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters.    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later thisyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that itwould take very little to touch off what he calls the secondphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in thedollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop onMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent withhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets arenot affected until a currency is in the final stages of itsdecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latestweakness was the loss of credibility that central bankssuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from fallingbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set aspart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss ofconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announcedplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronicimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.    Many economists believe that long-run stability will notreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap isaddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in themassive budget deficit.    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and ofcentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have nochoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.    ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is asubstantial increase in the discount rate and a correspondingcut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones.    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interestrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden forAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others.    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs andCo, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the FederalReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weakagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollarweakness,"" he said.    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress beingmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.    ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in thebudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobodycares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69will have been greater.    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse andthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly thata further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put onyour helmets,"" Giordano said.";money-fx

"EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>    ZURICH, April 9 - European currency markets reacted quietlyto the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealersranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete tosurprise that the markets should have expected so much.    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currenciesand traded in a narrow range after the communique, whichreaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currencystabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remainingbroadly entrenched in its current trading range.    ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase BankAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.    However, she said the dollar could break out of the rangewith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltdin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady againstthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,possibly to 140 yen.    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expectsa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curbunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negativesentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbankoperators to test the downside.    Concern that finance ministers and officials still inWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour ofcurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along withworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in thelong term, the traders said.    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at thecommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar'sdownward trend.    Traders in several centres said the market would look forfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks todefend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" TheU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.    However, some dealers said London-based operators would beunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the longEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers saidthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stablemarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extremevolatility seen in the first few months of this year.    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of thecommunique made clear the leading nations did not want afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvreaccord's supposed currency target range.    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets wereready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communiquecontributing to greater stability.    ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a bigboost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said heexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marksin the next three months.";money-fx

"BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION    FRANKFURT, April 8 - Bundesbank board member Claus Koehlercalled on central banks of major industrialised nations tocooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-releasedhere, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation wasprotectionism and control on capital movements.    ""Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange markettransactions to steer exchange rates where they want to havethem,"" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts wouldhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar dropto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange marketshad parted company with transactions in goods, services andinvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions thatdetermined market trends.    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates togrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rateswould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.    ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity,"" Koehler said.    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciationgoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steeprise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the costof European imports. But the volume effect of falling importsto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time tomake itself felt compared with the price effect.    ""Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be goingfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current accountover the medium term,"" Koehler said.    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occuronly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand shouldrise faster than GNP.    ""In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,"" Koehler said.    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to beprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset byan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..    But only if there was an appropriate interest ratedifferential would Europe and Japan look for financialinvestment in the U.S.    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bankhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact itsmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market ratesby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leadinginterest rates because of the signal this gives to the marketand its substantial impact on exchange rates.    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals ofprice stability, economic growth and full employment but alsoto tackle international problems like the exchange rateproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.    A strategy had to be designed that helped ""the safeguardingof non-inflationary economic growth in an internationalmonetary system largely free of disruptions,"" Koehler said.    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it wasnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficedto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates overthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,because they were only testing points for the market, he said.    In order to keep the international monetary system free ofdisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly butalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.";money-fx

"CURRENCY MOVES MAY BE HURTING WORLD TRADE<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 13 - Japanese trade figures are seriouslychallenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Groupof Seven industrialised nations that relative currency ratesare the key to smoothing world trade problems.    Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo saythey are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currenciesare the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japanshrinking?    What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar downmade world trade problems worse rather than solving them,fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast ofworld trade recession?    U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollarfall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Fivepact in New York.    The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pctmore competitive in Japan. The officials, most of themeconomists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan risingrapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declinedonly 11 pct against the yen.?    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widelyinterpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollarmust go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials canonly offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.    ""I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,"" said HughRichardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.    ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making ahell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, thereis money to be made in Japan,"" he added.    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive tradepractices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such asagriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonablechecking and customs procedures for car imports.    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in theface of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, theyblame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.    ""We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,""said a senior official, who declined to be named. ""We like torefrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.""    Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of theKeidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Moritarepeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort tounderstand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree.

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING<AUTHOR>    By Peter Bale, Reuters</AUTHOR>    SYDNEY, April 8 - Australian markets are booming as foreignfund managers redirect capital away from the United States andother traditional markets, analysts said.    High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market andan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow offresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese andU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash inand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as theydiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.    A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates inthe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for thecurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capitalare not available, but brokers said they received almost dailyinquiries from Japan and the United States.    ""These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing aboutand they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is endingup here with the attraction of high interest rates andreasonable currency stability,"" National Australia Bank Ltdeconomist Brian Hamley said.    ""There is a 'flight to quality',"" Hamley said. ""Australia maynot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't toomany other countries where you'd want to put your money.""    The stronger Australian dollar was also attractinginvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency againstthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.    ""We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.Where some people would be concerned about the value of theU.S. Dollar,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrosesaid. ""Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheapand the currency looks stable?""    But turning that capital into more permanent productiveinvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.    ""It will only disappear if people lose confidence in thedirection in the economy,"" Buttrose said, adding that offshoreinvestors would carefully watch the government's promised tougheconomic statement on May 14.    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yieldinginterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just aseasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who werebadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollarand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.    ""It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to bedelivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, onemight see a substantial outflow,"" Buttrose said.    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tougheconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt andstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.    ""They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I thinkthey would like to leave the money here,"" Buttrose said.    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increasedinterest in investment in Australia and the need to shieldJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged anelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currencypolicy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes offthe yen"" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had workedsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollarwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, theAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on atrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.    Offshore buying has also played a role in the boomingAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and othermarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to theweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring intoequities, particularly in the gold sector.    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, whilethe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in thesame period.    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanesecompanies that have invested heavily in the United States inrecent years turning their attention to undervalued realestate, particularly in the tourism field.    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-starRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrsas indicative of the type of property being sought.    ""They think they find good value real estate here which,with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind ofinvestment Australia needs,"" Buttrose added.";money-fx

"LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan</AUTHOR>    LONDON, Oct 20 - U.S. And West German reaffirmation ofsupport for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamentalproblems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind thecurrent collapse in stock markets, London economists said.    ""There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that thedollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said Richard Jeffrey ofHoare Govett. ""If not, there is going to be continued fear thatwhen pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced totighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in theU.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.""    But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, whichdragged other major markets down with it, may help curb thevery problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflationfears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.    ""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" saidGeoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments fromother London and Tokyo analysts.    Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears offurther falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationarypressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.    Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist theequity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.    ""It would be suicidal for any government in the context ofwhat happened in the last couple of days to jack up theirinterest rates,"" he added.    Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its primelending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fedchairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financialsystem.    The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stockcollapse would spill over into the economy, via a bankingcrisis for example, thus precipitating recession.    It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists saidtoday's whiplash moves do not have long term significance andthat markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals inmind.    ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economicgrowth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides amore realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel'sDennis. But he added that markets are still very much indanger.    ""The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing isdisappearing from the equity markets,"" Dennis noted.    David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said worldmarket turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven(G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,as implied by West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currenciesis still on.    Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered byexpectations that the Germans were more worried about the moneysupply impact of such intervention than maintaining currencystability.

"DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY<AUTHOR>    By Marcel Michelson, Reuters</AUTHOR>    AMSTERDAM, June 1 - A cut of about half a percentage pointin Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, althougheconomists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and widepremiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advancesrate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped itsrepurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.    That rate has remained in force, just holding above thefive pct official secured loans rate which governs commercialbank borrowings.    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West Germanrepo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate tothree pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered moneymarket rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loansrate on lending under its three month credit quota.    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and FinanceMinistry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said hewould follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the FinanceMinistry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billionguilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pctfor an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a differencebetween the secured loans rate which applies to lending underthe credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which addextra liquidity to the money market.    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move tofurther lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts wouldresult in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around itsparity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673guilders per 100 marks.    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a levelthat would not permit a change in the interest ratedifferential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealerssaid.    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German andDutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, hesaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflationexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest ratesin the longer term.    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,or even negative, while the latest official economic forecastspoint to a falling rate of economic growth.    ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreementnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""the ABN economist said.    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct inJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run totwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in thesecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.

"IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in aserious way, Japan investment managers say.    The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollarsecurities, have already sold U.S. Equities.    But ""if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happenyesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdrawsignificant funds from U.S. Shares,"" said Akira Kawakami, deputymanager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd'sinternational investment department.    An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japaneseinvestment in U.S. Bonds. ""Japan-U.S. Interest ratedifferentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothingin the absence of dollar stability,"" said Kawakami.    U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picturefollowing the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effectshould be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.    But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiatingto see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar washolding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.    ""Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks inNew York yesterday, most are still looking for chances tolighten their U.S. Stock inventories,"" Hiromitsu Sunada, managerof Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investmentdepartment said.    Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 pointsto 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.    ""Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,considering the dangers,"" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy generalmanager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixedincome securities marketing group.    Japanese investment at home could start to pick up oncemarkets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managerssaid. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in oneor two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield forthe 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.

"TREASURY'S BAKER SAYS SYSTEM NEEDS STABILITY    WASHINGTON, April 9 - Treasury Secretary James Baker saidthe floating exchange rate system has not been as effective ashad been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalancesfrom emerging in the global economy.    In remarks before the afternoon session of theInternational Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said hewas not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.    ""But I do suggest,"" he said, ""that we need something to giveit more stability and to keep it headed in the right directionwhen the wind shifts.""    He said that indicators can serve ""as a kind of compass"" butadded that structural indicators can help focus attention onsome policies.    Baker, however, said the IMF ""needs to move beyondmacroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators thatcan help focus attention on some of the policies of specificrelevance to the imbalances we face today.""    The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be givena more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- ArticleIV consultations -- that the Fund performs.    Baker also told the policy making group that it was timefor the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMFsurveillance more relevant to national policymakers and thepublic.    ""In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMFappraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use offollow-up reports on country actions to implement IMFrecommendations, and greater use of special consultationprocedures,"" he said.    Baker emphasized that indicators were a device ""for movingbeyond rhetoric to action.""    He said they provide ""more structure to the system, andinduce more discipline and peer pressure into the process ofpolicy coordination.""    He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to bereviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.    ""This should be matter of priority for the executive board,""he said.    Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternativemedium-term economic scenarios for countries that ""can help usfocus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, byidentifying options for addressing them and analyzing theimplications of these options.""    He said also that further work should be done on findingpaths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.

But he declined to say what measures would be discussedahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers latertoday.    Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl saidthe importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvreaccord, had been underestimated.    Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among majorcountries than six months ago, at the time of the annualmeeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,marked by sharp discord between the United States and its majortrading partners.

"BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE<AUTHOR>    By Felix Dearden</AUTHOR>    BONN, Oct 20 - The United States appears to have won atransatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interestrates, European economists said.    But they added Washington set the stakes high by testingthe limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets wereplunging.    West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment tocurrency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,according to official statements released late Monday.    Only 13 hours after the statements were released, theBundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banksliquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pctfacility rate offered last week.    While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbankpresident Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also addedmoney market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want astrong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.     ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew inLondon.    But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken oneof the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the WestGermans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05percentage point.""    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tighteningof West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall andfuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February'sLouvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetarypolicies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency marketsand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours tradingin New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar wasquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at DeutscheGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on worldstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in WestGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday.    ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock marketlosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fitswith Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and theBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following risesin the U.S., Aschoff said.    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the centralbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and hethought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First BostonLtd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreatand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as thesecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it wasbefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington.""    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord wasreaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidityat 3.60 pct, Keating noted.    Economists said the United States now appeared to haveagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and supportthe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinderWashington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenbergtold a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not ruleout central banks of leading industrial countries interveningon exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed WestGermany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currencystability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German centralbanks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force themto again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.";money-fx

GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS    FRANKFURT, April 9 - Remarks by central bankers raised somehopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchasepacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of amove in the near term, money market dealers said.    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterdaythat rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth fromspeculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state centralbank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lowerlimit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but thedrop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotmentthis week dashed some hopes of lower rates.    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday innew liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by thepact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates onrepurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour morediscreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather thanthe more public adjustment of leading rates.    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate andallow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the casesince it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it mayallow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.This should then flow back into the market as it is depositedwith banks.    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first sevendays of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above theestimated 51 billion required for all of April.;money-fx

"POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL    WASHINGTON, April 8 - Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsaid a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciationof the mark would damage prospects for sustained West Germaneconomic growth.    In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairshere, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aimfor a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar tocorrect the trade deficit.""    He said the United States could face a vicious circle ofdepreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took thatroute.    Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meetU.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and toleratingabove-target money supply growth.    He said he would have been happy to have brought forwardfive billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 tothe beginning of this year, but he said the government facedpolitical constraints getting such measures through the upperhouse of the West German parliament.    But there were also limits to the impact West Germany couldaccept on exports from a rising mark, he said.    Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for aboutone-third of its gross national product, so a substantialerosion of export markets could not be offset by increasingdemand at home.    ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be anobstacle to further growth,"" he said.    Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supplygrowth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation andbecause external factors, including low oil prices andfavourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.    But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemmaover monetary policy.    The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not thereported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germanywas affected more than before by exchange rate developments.    ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy moreon the external side, and we can live with a more expansionarymoney supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said.    He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan'strade surpluses, which affected European countries as well asthe United States.    Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetaryofficials of major industrialized countries, saying theimportance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchangerates had been underestimated.    All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about theright level, and that further changes would damage growth, hesaid.

"U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS<AUTHOR>    by Keith Leighty, Reuters</AUTHOR>    CHICAGO, April 9 - Commodities from gold to grains tocotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as lossesin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears ofinflation and economic instability.    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York.    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets.    ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""Ifthey do, it's not evident.""    ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be.    ""One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.    ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening,"" he said.    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick.    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains.

Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher.    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices.

"ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 9 - Economists said that they doubt theFederal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despitehigher discount window borrowings in the latest two-weekstatement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.    Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mlndlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.    ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but itprobably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings.    ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" saidWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today thatthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs ormore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss inits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewerreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.    The Fed took no market reserve management action lastThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It addedtemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reservesdirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that thetwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged onTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday'sovernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.    ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy atthis time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzisaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interestrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weakeconomies in the United States and abroad and add to thefinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders.    ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the lateststatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollartumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a newstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday'sWashington meetings of international monetary officials failedto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing inWednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view thatthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge tradeimbalance between the United States and Japan.    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming forsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly averageFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about wherethe rate has been since early November.    ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighterpolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan ofDean Witter.    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has justnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct fromsix to 6.10 pct previously.";money-fx

JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS    TOKYO, June 19 - Japan could avoid a sharp rise in thevalue of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. Andother nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, anadvisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency(EPA) said.    The advisory body said in its report that the yen wouldsoar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a globalbasis were delayed.    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall toslightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed torestructure their economies.    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cutJapan's current account surplus to two pct of gross nationalproduct (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a changewould slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annuallyduring the seven-year period to 1993.    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollarwould remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan'scurrent-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. Thisscenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.    It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economyand four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.;money-fx

"BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn and Anthony Williams</AUTHOR>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - News of a meeting between U.S. TreasurySecretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister GerhardStoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing thedollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.    News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in greatsecrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism byBaker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fearsthat the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.    The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over twopfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.    The announcement of the meeting, also attended byBundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneouslyin Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New Yorkmarkets.    Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policiesaccepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministryspokesman in Bonn said.    The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.    The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the marketreacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interestrates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said thatWest Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.    Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged tocoordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, withthe surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulatingtheir economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budgetdeficit.    West German government sources said rising West Germanmoney market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvrepact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interestrates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been risingsince May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fedraised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.    German yields have also risen over this period, but lessmarkedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged upshort-term rates by changing the terms on its securityrepurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering themoney market.    The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany'sinability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in theBundesbank central bank council about excessive monetarygrowth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,bank economists said.    This monetary tightening reflected a switch from thepragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehlsince early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to themore cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.    In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity thismorning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.    ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too muchunder American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser atSwiss Bank Corp here.    ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite asignificant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating,economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.    The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms ofthe Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pacton Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money marketeconomists said.    Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbankdoes not want a further strong rise in the tender allocationrate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.    The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indicationthat the meeting would take place, although the FinanceMinistry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.    Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked tocomment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvreaccord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying heassumed monetary cooperation would continue.    The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left WestGermany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visitDenmark and Belgium.";money-fx

"G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA    WASHINGTON, April 8 - Japanese Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmedtheir Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince themarket of their resolve.    At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawasaid the ministers and central bank governors did not believe atotally new statement was needed.    The speculative selling did not reflect economicfundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only areaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, hesaid.    He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve hadconcentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially themark, had remained stable.    Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since theParis accord was not worth being called fundamental.    ""As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expressionof 'current level' is rather vague idea,"" he said.

"NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES<AUTHOR>    by Patricia Campbell, Reuters</AUTHOR>    CHICAGO, June 2 - Currency futures are likely to movehigher following the sharp rally today after President Reaganannounced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term asFederal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominatedas his replacement, currency analysts said.    Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices betweennow and the June 8 Venice economic summit.    In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude tothe dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,analysts said.    Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearinga bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks inChicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was atechnical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,analysts said.       ""Disappointment of European central bankers over theappointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollarlower,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president CarolMackoff.    ""The international community will not like thisappointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy andthat Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought toreduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst DavidHorner.     Furthermore, ""that Greenspan was not named two months agosuggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,""Horner said.    A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futuresprior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigatedonly by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the G-7summit, he said.    But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, maybe at an impasse, analysts said.    Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neitherplanned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from theU.S. to do so, Mackoff said.    The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficitas Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.    Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut itsbudget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in thedollar could be forestalled, Horner said.    However, ""the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothingchanges,"" Horner said.    Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloanesaid European currencies will likely move to the higher end oftheir 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.

"U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND<AUTHOR>    BY HISANOBU OHSE, REUTERS</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 1 - The dollar's recent signs of stabilityhave raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves untilafter the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.    ""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if thedollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.    Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its valueagainst the yen and the mark as part of an officiallyorchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive onworld markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.    On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yenbut has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.    Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen farenough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.    The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in Marchfrom 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continuedimprovement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.    Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that iffurther progress is reported, the dollar would head back uptowards 150 yen.    ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomedout for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First NationalBank of Chicago.    Other factors supporting this bullish view were growingexpectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker wouldbe reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan'slarger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.    The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampenspeculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active centralbank intervention to support the dollar.    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week thatthe U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billiondlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amountsince the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.    Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's interventionvolume as ""impressive"".    James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the tradedata are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and140 yen.""    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New Yorkwarned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.""    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okadasaid market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline ofthe U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reactionto the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,which is likely to focus on the implementation of previouscommitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.    President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisionsmade last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group ofSeven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot beignored or forgotten.""    ""The commitments made at these meetings need to betranslated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear thebrunt of U.S. calls for further action.    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up onGermany to take stimulative action like Japan.""    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollarcould hold above 145 yen for some months it could also comeunder attack again if it seems the latest economic package isnot having much impact on Japan's economy and its tradesurplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trustbanks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollarpositons hedged against exchange losses in their foreignportfolios, while some others have started covering those shortpositions, Japanese bank dealers said.";money-fx

"LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY    LONDON, June 2 - The Louvre agreement by the Group of Sevenfinance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencieshas worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at theeconomic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of theExchequer Nigel Lawson said.    Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produceany major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters workremained to be done on improving the conditions for lastingworld economic growth.ü&#5;&#30;side measures to boost growth, he said.    ""I think it is possible that there may be scope for afurther reduction in interest rates in Germany,"" he added, butstressed that he had had no indication that such a move waslikely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.    Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on ""a gradual reductionof its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.""    He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavycoordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, andhe was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate.    Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. Maycurrency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playinga very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to avery much greater extent than we had done hitherto.""    Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement mayfalter if member states did not implement the macro-economiccommitments underlying the accord.    ""Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchangerate stability if countries are seen not to implement theircommitments in Paris ... In this respect."" He said the U.S.Budget deficit was ""very important.""    Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced byJapanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawsonsaid, ""what is really needed in Japan is an increase inmerchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.""    ""There is a specific range of consumer and agriculturalgoods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which iswholly unjustified,"" he said.    Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in ""Japanbashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulationpackage and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increaseJapanese development aid over the next three years.    Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchangemembership would also help deflect criticism, he said.    He said he thought West Germany would instead come underpressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures tojack up faltering economic growth.    In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bringforward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cutsscheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead withthe privatisation of German national industries.    On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British planto alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries tomake progress in Venice.    The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereigndebt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and WorldBank meetings in Washington earlier this year.    Lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backingfor the plan at the Venice summit"" and hoped the programme wouldbe finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.    He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and ChaseManhattan to increase sharply their Third World debtprovisions.    ""First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the marketresponse has shown that banks have much less to fear from thissort of move than they felt before Citicorp,"" he said.    U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.""They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,""Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves todetermine the appropriate size of provisions.

"EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE<AUTHOR>    By Richard Murphy, Reuters</AUTHOR>    ZURICH, April 9 - European currency markets reacted quietlyto the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealersranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete tosurprise that the markets should have expected so much.    The dollar opened lower against virtually all currenciesand traded in a narrow range after the communique, whichreaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currencystabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.    Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remainingbroadly entrenched in its current trading range.    ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase BankAG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.    However, she said the dollar could break out of the rangewith major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.    Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltdin Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady againstthe mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,possibly to 140 yen.    A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expectsa dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.    London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curbunderlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negativesentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbankoperators to test the downside.    Concern that finance ministers and officials still inWashington could issue more concrete statements in favour ofcurrency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along withworries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in thenear term, the traders said.    Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at thecommunique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar'sdownward trend.    Traders in several centres said the market would look forfresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks todefend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadlyconsistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policyintentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""    Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" TheU.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.    However, some dealers said London-based operators would beunlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the longEaster weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.    Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers saidthe G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stablemarket for the foreseeable future compared with the extremevolatility seen in the first few months of this year.    One dealer at a German bank said the wording of thecommunique made clear the leading nations did not want afurther dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.    The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvreaccord's supposed currency target range.    A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets wereready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""    But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communiquecontributing to greater stability.    ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a bigboost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said heexpects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marksin the next three months.    A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, saidthe communique had been in line with realistic expectations andshould not have produced disappointment.    ""The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and tradepolicies to redress current imbalances are of a differenttimescale than currency markets operate on,"" the source toldReuters, ""This is a political process which takes time.""    Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp inBasle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident oncurrency markets today. ""Did people really expect a patentremedy?"" he asked.    Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was onlythe first in a series and said the market would watch carefullyin the next few weeks for any changes in positions.    A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus wasnow on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move byJapan and West Germany to boost their economic growth couldlead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.    Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary inpushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming monthswhile central banks appear resolved to use their muscle tosupport the Paris accord.";money-fx
VOLKSKAS BANK SEES RAND HINGING ON INFLATION RATE    JOHANNESBURG, Oct 19 - South Africa must drive down itsinflation rate to much lower levels to prevent a furtherdecline in the rand, said Volkskas Bank in its monthly economicreview.

"TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN<AUTHOR>    By Rie Sagawa</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watchingnervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below thesignificant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.    ""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it isconsidered to be the lower end of the reference range. If thecurrency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichiKangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.    The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Fridaycloses of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.    The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New Yorkand 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.    The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.    ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearishsentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. Hesaid this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation amongthe group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement theLouvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.    The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-daydrop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weaknessin U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.    Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but hestrongly criticised West German moves to raise key interestrates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatiencewith some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accorddue to their fears of increasing inflation.    Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationarypressures also slow domestic demand.    West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings toboost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Tradedeficit, Tanaka said.    U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a stillmassive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interestrates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.    ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nationscoordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchangedepartment.    The target range set by the Louvre accord is generallyconsidered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.    ""The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the nearfuture and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nationsfailing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvreaccord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,""Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as lowas 135 yen soon.";money-fx

Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buyback securities pledged on May 6.    Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today asan earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectivelywithdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market withtoday's allocation.    A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that thewithdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of creditpolicy, but was to be seen in the context of plentifulliquidity in the banking system.    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbankover the first six days of the month, well clear of the likelyApril minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banksthemselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.    Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too muchliquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt theeffectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its mainopen-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Twofurther pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.

INDIA RELAXES RULES FOR EXPORT PROMOTION    NEW DELHI, June 29 - The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to useforeign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annualexport earnings for export promotion abroad.    The move is designed by the government to improve India'strade deficit.    Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange PermitScheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, varioustextiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering andelectronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sportsgoods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.    The scheme replaces current rules which allow differentamounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain aminimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.    RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products willqualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotionalspending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board valueof annual export earnings.    These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw andsemi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.    RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of thetwo groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of theirfreight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.    Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerablyhigher than the previous limits, are also more flexible becauseholders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply toRBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.;cotton

"PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS    ISLAMABAD, June 29 - Pakistani government allowed freercotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimedat narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech the government had also decided to allowduty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industrymore competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export ofPakistani products.       Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s.    But Haq said now the private sector would also exportcotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets along-standing demand of the local traders.    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed tobring down prices and help the local ancillary industriescompete effectively in the world market, he said.       Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years butreviewed every year.    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcingtrade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it wouldenable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over alonger period.    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been providedfor the export of engineering goods to selected third worldcountries on soft credit terms.       Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 percent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.    He said the government policy was to rationalise andstreamline import controls.    ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, localindustry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" hesaid.

"IVORY COAST WEATHER NO PROBLEM FOR 1986/87 CROPS    ABIDJAN, June 29 - Ivory Coast rainfall this season hasbeen less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffeeproduction has not suffered, the official Ivorian dailyFraternite Matin reported.    The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dryconditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant ifthere is good rainfall in coming weeks.    Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowestin northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop hasespecially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matinsaid.    Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier thismonth 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.    Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculturehad been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does notneed very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants havebeen affected in some regions, it added.    London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It describedearly development of the new main crop as patchy.    The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this yearforecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coastdue to drought in the western part of the country. It estimatedthe crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's4.33 mln bag harvest.    Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffeecrop as ""normal.""";cotton
"U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS<AUTHOR>    by Keith Leighty, Reuters</AUTHOR>    CHICAGO, April 9 - Commodities from gold to grains tocotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as lossesin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears ofinflation and economic instability.    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York.    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets.    ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""Ifthey do, it's not evident.""    ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be.    ""One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.    ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening,"" he said.    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick.    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains.    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand.    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher.    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They saidhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals.";cotton
CHINA FORECASTS 397 MLN TONNES GRAIN HARVEST    PEKING, Oct 19 - China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the NewChina News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesmanas saying.    The harvest will be China's second highest in history butpoor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmershave kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.    Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mlntonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.    Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mlntonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09mln in the same 1986 period.    Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state pricesfor grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increasethe incentive for grain production.    China could not afford to become a major food importer, hesaid.    The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390mln tonnes.;cotton

TANZANIAN COTTON THREATENED BY LACK OF STORAGE    DAR ES SALAAM, Oct 20 - About 60,000 tonnes of harvestedraw cotton may be spoiled by rain in Tanzania's northernShinyanga region because it is stored in the open or in crudevillage sheds, radio Tanzania reported.    The cotton, worth one billion shillings, cannot be moved toginneries in the region because most mill warehouses are full.Many mills are not working because of a lack of spare parts, itadded.

PAKISTAN ALLOWS PRIVATE COTTON, RICE EXPORTS    ISLAMABAD, June 29 - The Pakistani government allowed theprivate sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policyannounced to cover the next three years.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free importof cotton yarn.    Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton andrice along with the state corporations.    He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to makehigh quality yarn available to local ancillary industries andto enable them to compete effectively in the world market. Thiswould help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said.;cotton
"WEST TEXAS COTTON CROP UNSCATHED BY STORM    NEW YORK, June 18 - The West Texas cotton crop was largelyunscathed by an isolated thunderstorm in that region last nightthat packed hurricane-force winds, crop and weather expertssaid.    ""There might have been some isolated storms, but certainlynothing damaging,"" said Charles Stichler, an extensionagronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far WestTexas.    Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the NewYork cotton futures market rally sharply this morning.   Cotton for December delivery was 1.35 cents higher at 70.95cents a lb at midsession after peaking this morning at 71.25cents.    ""What happened is that the storm hit Lubbock airport, andwhen that happens, everybody sees it,"" said Dale Mohler, asenior meteorologist with Accu-Weather Inc.    Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, whichproduces about 80 pct of that state's crop.    The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. ""That's hurricaneforce. But they were isolated to just a small portion of theWest Texas area, probably less than five pct,"" Mohler said.    ""No doubt there was some damage. But if it had hit in Julyor August (when fruiting would be underway) it would have beenworse,"" Mohler said.    About 60 pct of the West Texas cotton crop has beenplanted, and the remainder could be done by the weekend ifweather remains hot and dry, Stichler said.    The temperature in West Texas since mid-week has been about95 degrees. But a hot spell was sorely needed after far heavierthan normal rainfall for several weeks, he said.";cotton

NEW ZEALAND CPI RISES 2.3 PCT IN MARCH QUARTER    WELLINGTON, April 14 - New Zealand's consumer price index,CPI, which measures the rate of inflation, rose 2.3 pct in thequarter ended March 31 against an 8.9 pct rise in the December1986 quarter and a 2.3 pct rise in the March 1986 quarter, theStatistics Department said.    For the 12 months ended March 1987 the CPI rose 18.3 pctagainst 18.2 pct in 12 months ended December 1986 and 13.0 pctin the 12 months ended March 1986, it said in a statement.    Nearly half the increase in the latest quarterly index wascontributed by the housing group, the department said.    The December quarter was significantly affected by theintroduction of a 10 pct value added goods and services tax,GST, in October 1986, it added.    However, some GST charges not measured in the December 1986quarter influenced the latest March quarterly figure, it said.    This is because of an unavoidable lag in price information,particularly on housing, used cars and insurance on householdcontents, it added.;cpi

"INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY    BONN, April 13 - The five leading West German economicresearch institutes have failed to agree about how strongly thedomestic economy will expand this year but revised downforecasts contained in a report published six months ago.    The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essenpredicted in the institutes' joint spring report that grossnational product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, comparedwith 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecastthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlinand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.    The joint report said that the estimates of economicdevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly lessfavourable"" than those of the other three.    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after aslow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will,however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said.    The two institutes said external economic factors whichwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports woulddominate the economic environment throughout the year. They sawexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted nomarked improvement in the course of the year.    The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline indemand and production (seen) in the winter months does notindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.""    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporateuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.But they expected that many investments had not been cancelledbut only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.""    They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuationof the economic uptrend are still favourable.""    These three institutes said diminishing external burdenscombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn indemand and production could be expected by the spring.    However, this projection was clouded by risks including thefurther development of the mark against the dollar.    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said thatwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of theeconomy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exportswill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge duringthe course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fallin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.    The three more positive institutes saw private consumptionrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving butpredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline inunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said thejobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people inwork of about 200,000.    These three institutes said new jobs would be createdmainly in the private services sector and also by the state inthe context of job creation measures. The construction industrywas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980but they predicted either no rise in employment in themanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur onlyin the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in themanufacturing industry will decline.""    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw acurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marksand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start torise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all fivepredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.";cpi

Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with theconvertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to adeterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currencyarea rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY<AUTHOR>    By Rory Channing, Reuters</AUTHOR>    KUWAIT, April 8 - Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-riddeneconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil priceswill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economistssay.    Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to holdoil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in thenorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.    Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of grossdomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last yearafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.    This was after taking into account inflation in consumerprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.    Factors depressing economic activity include the6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, whichthreatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through theGulf and has sapped business confidence.    But sentiment received a much-needed boost in Septemberwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisiscaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensivenew debt settlement program was introduced.    The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forwardtrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.    The cheques were also used as collateral for consumerspending, thus generating an informal credit system.    Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums arestill owed by individuals and companies.    There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of whichone-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank asbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said itwill not allow any banks to go under.    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling ofproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whetherdebtors have regular cash flows or not.    Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rightsguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significancein a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sectoris the biggest after oil.    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to rideout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned lastyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.    But strategic diversification into downstream operations inEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment athome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sellover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processedproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than ascrude.    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reasonfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domesticinflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recentyears and signs government spending on productive sectors willremain steady.    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct belowthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hitGulf.    Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were putofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment incomeof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, thesereserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit forthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.    This left out income from state reserves, usually excludedin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers atup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in someshortfall.    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast foreconomic growth this year or next.    ""It depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""This summer isimportant.""    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sundaythe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise statespending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate theeconomy.    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to bespelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.";cpi
"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST CUT SPENDING, ANZ SAYS    SYDNEY, April 13 - The government must announce harsh cutsin spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to givean adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZBanking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> said.    Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against thebackdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthlyBusiness Indicators publication.    ""For the past two years, the government has struggled withan economic reality that demands measures beyond those which itsees as politically practicable,"" it said.    The political climate meant there would be a continuedover-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate andmaintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.    ""The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revivalof business investment will be further postponed,"" it said.    The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted byexport and import-replacement industries which had created afalse suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance ofpayments crisis were past. ""Unfortunately, successful adjustmentto Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains along-term process,"" it said.    In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderateoverall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP)rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.    The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDPthis year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would growstrongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion atend-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.

"GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY    BONN, April 13 - Four of West Germany's five leadingeconomic research institutes warned that excessive monetarygrowth threatened a resurgence of inflation.    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, saidthe expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did notnecessarily threaten stability.    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in whichthree -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise inGNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome inview of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience hasshown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a pricerise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears mayseem exaggerated, they said.    ""But it has often turned out in the past that the priceclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank intoa restrictive policy,"" they said.    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy areless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.    The four institutes disputed the view that monetaryexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domesticinvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital marketinvestments following lower interest rates.    ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion ofcentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to asmaller expansion of money supply,"" they said.    A return to growth and stability did not requirespectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly withopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoidan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not befocused simply on growth of production potential. Because ofuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economicweakness other factors should be taken into account.    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cutsand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluationspeculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threatin itself to price stability.    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growthreflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and thefalling mark.";cpi
PHILIPPINE INFLATION PREDICTED TO RISE    MANILA, Oct 19 - The Philippine 1987 inflation rate willrise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the governmentimplements an employers' association recommendation for a 10pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.    The government's own proposal for an across-the-board dailypay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eightpesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year averagehigher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.    The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by theEmployers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).    The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflationrate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solitasaid. Both were proposed last month.    Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pctby the National Economic and Development Authority early thismonth.    In the first three months of the year, inflation was anegative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National StatisticsOffice said.    The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pctin July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and Septemberrespectively, the National Statistics Office said.    It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and waterprices.    The government's six and eight peso wage increases woulddisplace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the numberof unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.;cpi
"JOINT ACTION SAID VITAL TO BOOST WORLD GROWTH    PARIS, June 18 - Prospects for world economic growth remainvery sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments isurgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilizecurrencies and encourage investment, the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.    ""The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large paymentsimbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of itsgloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.    The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc ofwestern industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's2.5 pct growth rate.    ""We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD areacomfortably exceeding three pct,"" David Henderson, head of theOECD's economics and statistics department, said.    The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to risinginflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third worlddebt problem to increase the risks of a world economicdownturn.    ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growthremain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most majorcountries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interestrates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexiblelabor markets.    But private sector confidence had been undermined byuncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""forconfidence to be restored, it is important for governmentsswiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.""    This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accordof the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.    The OECD said that apparent disagreements among majorcountries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped toundermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscalpolicies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demandin the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.    Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announcedrecently by the Japanese government to encourage public worksand cut taxes would make a significant contribution to thisprocess, though it was too early to estimate its preciseimpact.    He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domesticdemand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.    The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, hasworsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecastto rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pctincrease in 1986.    There is no prospect for any significant improvement in theunemployment situation over the next 18 months, with theaverage rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to lastyear.    The OECD called for efforts to liberalize worldagricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away fromprice guarantees and other measures linked to productiontowards direct income support for farmers.<!DOCTYPE lewis SYSTEM ""lewis.dtd"">";cpi
"ECONOMIC GROWTH SEEN SLUGGISH IN BENELUX COUNTRIES    PARIS, June 19 - Economic growth will remain sluggish inthe Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment mayrise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Developmentforecast.    Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year andnext year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECDsaid in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation couldstabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surpluswill probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.    While the Belgian government has made progress in trimmingits borrowing requirement, ""it will probably be insufficient tocheck the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,"" the OECD said.    In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becomingless competitive and imports rising. ""Employment is forecast todecelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in theprivate sector and budgetary cuts,"" the report said.    Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of decliningdomestic gas prices.

HIGHER GROWTH, UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE, OECD SAYS    PARIS, June 19 - France's growth rate is expected tostrengthen in the second half of this year after a poor firsthalf, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECDforecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said therate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantlyhigher than in the first half of this year.    The OECD said France's economic situation has deterioratedsomewhat during the early months of 1987.     Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventoryadjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflationhas reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely toreach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.    The report said inflation should slow and domestic demandpick up in the second half of this year. But both data arelikely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.    The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices forthe second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first sixmonths. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pctfor the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.;cpi
"PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS<AUTHOR>    By Pascal Fletcher, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LISBON, April 13 - Portugal's economy, which has beenenjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latestgovernment crisis, analysts said.    But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal CavacoSilva's government could slow economic reforms and investmentas Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the EuropeanCommunity, which it joined in January last year, they said.    Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, wastoppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.    The centre-right administration had made economic growthreform a priority in its 17 months in office.    In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its currentaccount surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs andinflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.    Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instabilitywere worrying but they felt the foundations for continuedgrowth had not been badly shaken.    ""The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that isnow less dependent on the political situation,"" said FritzHaser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.    ""The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,"" economistJorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.    Businessmen have identified political instability over thelast 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lastingeconomic progress.    The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974revolution.    Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remainbuoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surgein economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largelyunderpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.    Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank ofPortugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growthwould remain at similar levels this year.    But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policiesand could slow economic development.    Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the endof the month, can either call early elections or form a newgovernment from parties in the existing left wing-dominatedparliament.    Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quickelections as the best solution. ""There is a good chance that amajority government could result from early elections,""Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president PedroFerraz da Costa said.    He said they were optimistic this could mean thecontinuation in the near future of liberalisation policiesintroduced over the last year.    The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, butthe PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion pollssay they could win an overall majority.    A PSD majority would also open the way for morewide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws andpossible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.    Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition partiesof blocking key economic reforms.    The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic resultswere more the product of favourable international conditionssuch as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSDpolicies.";cpi
"S.AFRICA EXPECTED TO UNVEIL EXPANSIONARY BUDGET<AUTHOR>    By Christopher Wilson, Reuters</AUTHOR>    CAPE TOWN, June 2 - South Africa is expected to unveiltomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive yearin a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,economic analysts said.    Faced with competing demands for increased military andpolice spending and the pressing need for more funds for blackhousing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis isexpected to raise significantly the government's overallexpenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,the analysts said.    Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in statespending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for thefinancial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleasfrom the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.    ""Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, butsimply raising government spending and increasing the budgetdeficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,"" said Rob Lee,chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.    South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjustedgrowth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year ofless than one pct.    Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled toover 30 pct.    Economists estimate that the government's spending targetwill rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted ataround 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficitbefore borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct ofGDP.    The government, having consistently overshot its ownspending targets for more than a decade, also faces acredibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in thebudget, analysts said.    ""The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,""said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.    Many analysts in the private sector are now paying lessattention to the figures presented in the budget and are usingtheir own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for themoney and capital markets.    South African Mutual's Lee believes government spendingwill again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by theIMF.    ""The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,"" predictedone analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily awayfrom austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the pasttwo years.    The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in thepolitical situation and the onset of an economic crisistriggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll overloans to the country in September 1985.    Against a background of Western economic sanctions, fallingper capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,government officials say economic growth is the primeobjective.    But private-sector economists caution that the government'sability to promote growth by boosting state spending isconstrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on thecurrent account of the country's balance of payments.    Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on thenation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of anarrangement reached earlier this year with major internationalcreditor banks.    Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis haslittle room to manoeuvre.    Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries andbudgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office andSouth African Transport Services suggest that major taxconcessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.    Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessionsfor taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-onlyelection. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.    ""This will not be a very exciting budget,"" commented HarrySchwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal ProgressiveFederal Party. ""I do not expect any major tax cuts as all thesweets were given out before the election.""";cpi

"U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 13 - Major U.S. banks may lift primelending rates again within days due to recent increases intheir borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve isnudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.    In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, mostbanks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their owncost of money. That spread has narrowed again.    ""A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,""said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.    Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct isjustified because the spread between banks' cost of funds andthe prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of apercentage point.    He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentagepoints since last October until it fell below one point andtriggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.    ""We could easily have another prime rate increase as soonas this week,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.    ""We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in thenear future,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.    ""Based on the spread between the prime rate and fundingcosts, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,""said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the primebecause that would dampen already fairly weak business loandemand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintainrecent upward pressure on money market interest rates.    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures liftshort-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. Hesaid ""if there is widespread belief money market rates willstay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.""    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep adollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollarfell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traderssaid the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way tostabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actionson Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said ""it has becomeclear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressurein the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.""    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interestrates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculationthat the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in themarket than most economists had expected.    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in smallamounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreementswith the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one anotherhigh at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pcttoday, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlrround of customer repurchase agreements.    ""The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it isoffering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,""said Jones of Lanston.    ""The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on theneed to defend the dollar,"" Jones said. He believes it ismerely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have amajor impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policyovertly at some point.""    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates bybecoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, withinfour to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct mightwell be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts tofurther aid the dollar.    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime ratemay be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.    ""The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tighteningpolicy to defend the dollar,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp. Hesaid tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressuresabate will show whether or not it is firming policy.  ";interest
BELGIUM CUTS TREASURY CERTIFICATE RATES    BRUSSELS, June 18 - The Belgian National Bank said it cutone, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by0.10 points, effective immediately.

A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was madeafter a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, andwas not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pctdiscount rate.    The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especiallythe three-month rate, have been the National Bank's mainmonetary policy instrument for the last two years.

"U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA<AUTHOR>    By Sandy Critchley</AUTHOR>    LONDON, Oct 20 - An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stgsurge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely tonudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy aslong as sterling remains in its present robust state,economists said.    An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over thepast two days will in any case subdue personal consumer creditdemand which has largely been behind growth in lending.    ""In the normal course of events the markets would have beenextremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.    After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,which compared won stg August rise, U.K.Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to fleefrom plummetting equities into the relative security ofgovernment securities.    Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching aday's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tonethroughout.    U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morningafter little more than a token blip as the figures came out.    Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by bankswould under other circumstances have prompted market fears of arise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""Withthe financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the lastthing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said.    ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long assterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,""said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell MontaguGilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow moneymeasure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pctgrowth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.    But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has sloweddown is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to afall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad moneyaggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.    It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bankof England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base ratesto 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently bynews of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.    Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry inthat period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.    Housing and equities were the key two asset markets ininfluencing consumer behaviour, he said.    In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equitymarkets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be astraightforward impact on consumer spending and on retailsales,"" Temperton said.    ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth inconsumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added.    ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lendingfigure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a veryserious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said.    A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to lookat all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowlythan bank lending.    Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lendingwas evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavypersonal sector borrowing.    Figures from the Banking Information Service showedpersonal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise.

"GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn</AUTHOR>    FRANKFURT, Oct 19 - Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany'scentral bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg arenormally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt thecentral bank's independence.    But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over acontroversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes ofthe country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.    Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt lastThursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs andinterest rates    Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl'scriticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive placefor foreign investors.    ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank andFinance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreigninvestors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who askednot to be identified.    Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financialpolicy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship tosteer the economy through a particularly difficult time.    ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will resultin things getting back to normal again after a period of illfeeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.    News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pctwithholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds ina market already reeling from rising interest rates at home andabroad.    Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way thefinance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting theBundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflictingdetails to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.    Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been underextraordinary pressures lately.    Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by hisdeputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fightinflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he hadpursued so far this year to promote currency stability.    In recent statements Poehl has sounded more likeSchlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has beenwarning in speech after speech that excessive money supplygrowth would eventually lead to rising prices.    Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbankcouncil, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent hisviews, bankers said.    ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank'sPfister.    ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is notentirely his own,"" said another economist.    The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the markand hurting West German exporters.    The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since theBundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.    Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary JamesBaker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.    Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany tostimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.    One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a roundof tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.    But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult forStoltenberg than he had bargained for.    The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly votedmost popular government politician last year, had to faceresistance from local barons in the government coalitionparties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.    The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising4.3 billion marks.    But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it willpush up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs thegovernment could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.    Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political rowwhich has turned into the country's worst political scandal.    Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington lastmonth early to sort out a row in the northern state ofSchleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.    The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign afterallegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavylosses for the CDU in state elections.    Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva lastweekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.    Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the moreremarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, andwas appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.    When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier thisyear, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition governmentgave Poehl another eight-year term.    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said hehoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.    But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he wasnot only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating theBundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.";interest

"TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - Plunging Tokyo stock prices will preventthe Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could evenforce it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,government and private economists said.    A rise in interest rates now would only serve to sparkfurther selling of shares that could ultimately have a majordeflationary impact on the real economy, they said.    Although Bank of Japan officials have consistentlymaintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discountrate, many in the markets have thought otherwise.     Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by thecentral bank's apparent decision last week to countenancehigher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.    But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed toraise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about arenewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.    Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as themarkets concluded that the stock market's collapse precludedthe central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discountrate increase.    A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent afurther drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. ""They need tosupport the stock and security markets,"" he said.    But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to changepolicy for the moment, although one admitted that the centralbank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock pricescontinue to plunge during the rest of the week.    Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed theeconomy is better placed now to cope with the deflationaryimpact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.    With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop instock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer andbusiness confidence, one government economist said.    ""There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won'tbe that big,"" said another.    Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on theirown, although they do participate through trust funds and otherinvestment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turnedto financial market investments for profits during last year'seconomic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them torefocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.    Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that ispartly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies haveshifted funds away from financial investments to increaseinventories and step up capital spending, one governmenteconomist said.    In deciding what response to make to the steep stock pricedrop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether priceswill continue to fall further and then decide if they pose agreater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,one central bank official said. ""That will at least take acouple of days, if not weeks,"" he said.";interest
"GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT    FRANKFURT, April 9 - Remarks by two leading central bankerssparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut inthe West German three pct discount rate may be underdiscussion, currency dealers said.    Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech thatmonetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflowsrequired cuts in interest rates.    Separately, West Berlin state central bank president DieterHiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall belowits lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he wasnot making a forecast on interest rates, however.    Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollargained slight background support from the speculation.    But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the moneymarket this week, dashing some expectations that it may eitheroffer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rateand let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.    It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much lessthan the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pactexpired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank couldmove to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.    Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculativecapital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless ofwhether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.    ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity.""

SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES    MADRID, April 9 - The head of Spain's employers'federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worriedabout the government's monetary policies because high realinterest rates were hampering investment.    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far thisyear were not endangering the government's five pct inflationtarget. The government's perceived need to control inflation bykeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.    High real interest rates were attracting an influx ofspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting thegovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and atarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call moneyrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from11.8 at end-1986.    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call tohold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and newwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanishworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected thestate sector, where the government is trying to impose its fivepct wage ceiling.    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend inSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the firsttwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pctincrease over the corresponding period last year.    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of thepeseta to correct the imbalance.;interest

"BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</AUTHOR>    FRANKFURT, June 2 - The Bundesbank is unlikely to changecredit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursdayfor its last session before the Venice summit, bankingeconomists and money market dealers said.    The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last monthby cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and isunlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest ratesin the near future, they said.    The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting willbe followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.    But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference wasusually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, anddid not necessarily herald any policy moves.    Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said todaythere was no reason to cut interest rates because money supplygrowth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar wasstable against the mark.    Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank hasopened a representative office, that the West German economywas now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.    Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold ina 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after theBundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at aminimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.    ""They have set this signal and indicated they could maybelower market rates even further, but not with the discount orLombard,"" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.    Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, saidGerman rates were among the lowest in industrial countries andaround historical lows for West Germany.    A further cut in rates would have little impact on theeconomy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.    The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a moveon interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.""The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,"" he said.    A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them inline with the new structure of money market rates since lastmonth, would have little practical significance, dealers said.    The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted adiplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.    But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made itclear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere ""eyewash.""    Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government tocut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetarypolicy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.    But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced taxcuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budgetdeficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.    ""The Bonn government will be in a very weak position inVenice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,""said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.    Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen beforeVenice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. ""But Idon't expect any convincing measures,"" he said.    Money market dealers noted that call money continued tonormalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterdayand as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up bymonth-end distortions.    Call money could come under upwards pressure later thismonth because of a major round of tax payments by banks onbehalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.    Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate fundstomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.    But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank wouldallocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would notrepresent a tightening of policy, however.    Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocatesat the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a fullallocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.    On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likelyto lift restrictions on private use of the European CurrencyUnit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.    Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcementon this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of theSaarland bordering France, and was twice under Frenchoccupation this century.    But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to comethis week, as a number of technical and legal matters had stillto be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would betreated for minimum reserve purposes.";interest

"U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, June 19 - More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyersfixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makesthe same monthly payment no matter what happens to otherinterest rates.    And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels inyears, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyerstrying to lock into cheap money.    The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officialssaid, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the homemortgage business.    While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., Theywere the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only afew years ago.    But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as lowas three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in theirportfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct toinduce them to retain their accounts.    As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or wereforced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whoserates would move in line with the cost of funds.    ""We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,""said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,explaining why his institution, for the time being, is onlyoffering variable rate mortgages.    The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helpedhomebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lendersconcede they are being forced to undercut each other stillmore.    Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlierthis week by the nation's two largest building societies and byNational Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition fornew business, officials at all three institutions said.    The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates evenbelow those on the variable rate loans.    ""Of course they are less profitable than other (variablerate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, whichearlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed ratenew mortgage loans.    But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitableloans because, ""It was just another way to attract people to ourmortgage product.""    Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixedrate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.    The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans wasexhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.    ""Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, notingthat within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pctof its 1986 volume.    In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that theyoffer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interestrates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made thelender is earning an above average return on assets.    But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has wonthe benefit of cheap money.    Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixedrate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumptionthat a Conservative Party victory would help money market ratesfall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.    Young explained that the company had planned to protectitself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying acomplicated hedging instrument.    But money market rates have risen contrary to expectationsand the company has shelved its plans for the time being. Hesaid money market rates were too high to arrange both themortgages and hedge profitably.    However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co doesmake fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. Thismeans bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bondand selling them to an investor.    For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and moreefficient with fixed rate rather than with floating ratemortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popularagain, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage moneyover the past few years.";interest

Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of histwo central bank council colleagues.    But he added that the last central bank council meeting onApril 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of""subdued optimism,"" particularly influenced by the news broughtby several state central bank presidents.    ""Much is going better than the impression gained by thepublic from the January figures, which have been in themeantime superseded,"" he said.

"TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - As official Washington sought torestore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Streetcollapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire fromcritics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.    Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank forboosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of aninternational accord to stabilize currency values.    Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, wasamong those who said the treasury secretary's statements helpedspur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investorsthink that a clash between the two major economic powers woulddamage the world economy.    Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""Ithink the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, Ithink, was partly due to statements that have been made bysenior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was adispute that should never have happened, he added.    Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at ahastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the UnitedStates on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip toScandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.    Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""Histiming could not have been worse.""    One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actuallythought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smackthe dollar down would work. That doesn't show muchunderstanding of international monetary gamesmanship.""    However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn marchtoward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.    ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but ifyou go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financialmarkets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca ofNikko Securities International in New York.    ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, somaking him responsible for it was a little like killing themessenger,"" he said.    After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governmentsmade it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced togetherin Paris in February, was still in effect.    Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might bea prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar tothe late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crashwiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.   Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy aboutBonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep theglobal recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interestrate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.    He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59thmonth, could no longer be the only engine of global economicexpansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a hugemarket for debtor country exports.    Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worriedthat the Republican party might face next year's presidentialelection with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badlytarnished.    A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debtcrisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that hasalready slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.    ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on theeconomy, and it's important that the psychology turn aroundquickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, andeventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,""former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in atelevision interview.    In many ways, the official response was mild.    Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,with President Reagan speaking for most people by admittingthat he was ""puzzled.""    U.S. government sources said the secretary immediatelyreturned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developmentsand, presumably, their political impact.    For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status inWashington will diminish because of the market fall.    Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll becauseof the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator LloydBentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late tobe doing that...You have an administration that's taken theattitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't dothat.""";interest
"U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 9 - Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financialmarkets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar'swake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology thatis likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.    For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's declineas the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fellsharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.    But that confidence is now cracking as the financialmarkets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker'soften-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.    ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollarfreefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" saidDavid Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.    The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washingtonfailed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have acredible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, shortof further depreciation of the dollar.    Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amidworries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scareaway foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.    The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spikein interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average downby 33 points to 2339.    Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called themarkets' instability frightening. He believes economicfundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""onceyou start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.""    ""There's a stark possibility that you could get adestabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest ratesand drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.""    Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economicsin Washington, has been warning for a long time that thecontrolled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.    ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... Butthe agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters.    Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later thisyear, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that itwould take very little to touch off what he calls the secondphase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in thedollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.    The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop onMarch 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.    The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent withhistorical experience, which teaches that domestic markets arenot affected until a currency is in the final stages of itsdecline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.    Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latestweakness was the loss of credibility that central bankssuffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from fallingbelow 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set aspart of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.    Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss ofconfidence was triggered last week when Washington announcedplans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronicimports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.    Many economists believe that long-run stability will notreturn to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap isaddressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in themassive budget deficit.    But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and ofcentral bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have nochoice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.    ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is asubstantial increase in the discount rate and a correspondingcut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones.    Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interestrates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden forAmerican farmers, Latin American governments and others.    But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs andCo, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the FederalReserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weakagainst just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollarweakness,"" he said.    Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress beingmade toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.    ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in thebudget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobodycares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69will have been greater.    He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse andthinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.    But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly thata further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put onyour helmets,"" Giordano said.";interest

"BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION    FRANKFURT, April 8 - Bundesbank board member Claus Koehlercalled on central banks of major industrialised nations tocooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.    In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-releasedhere, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation wasprotectionism and control on capital movements.    ""Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange markettransactions to steer exchange rates where they want to havethem,"" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts wouldhave to be revised downward because of the recent dollar dropto 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.    Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange marketshad parted company with transactions in goods, services andinvestments. It was the scale of speculative transactions thatdetermined market trends.    Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates togrow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rateswould have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.    ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required aredifferent from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result ofmounting economic activity,"" Koehler said.    The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciationgoing by talking the dollar down posed problems.    The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steeprise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the costof European imports. But the volume effect of falling importsto the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time tomake itself felt compared with the price effect.    ""Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be goingfurther than would be necessary to adjust the current accountover the medium term,"" Koehler said.    A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occuronly if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand shouldrise faster than GNP.    ""In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,"" Koehler said.    If a further appreciation of the dollar was to beprevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset byan inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..    But only if there was an appropriate interest ratedifferential would Europe and Japan look for financialinvestment in the U.S.    When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bankhad to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact itsmeasures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.    Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market ratesby operating on the open market rather than adjusting leadinginterest rates because of the signal this gives to the marketand its substantial impact on exchange rates.    It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals ofprice stability, economic growth and full employment but alsoto tackle international problems like the exchange rateproblem, the debt problem and the current account problem.    A strategy had to be designed that helped ""the safeguardingof non-inflationary economic growth in an internationalmonetary system largely free of disruptions,"" Koehler said.    Given the system of floating exchange rates, it wasnecessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficedto tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates overthe next few years and intervention points should not be set,because they were only testing points for the market, he said.    In order to keep the international monetary system free ofdisruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly butalso cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.";interest
U.S. TO END NETHERLANDS ANTILLES TAX TREATY    WASHINGTON, June 29 - The Treasury Department said itnotified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles andAruba.    The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasurysaid in a two-sentence announcement.    The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiationsbetween the United States and the Netherlands over the pasteight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesmansaid.    The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies ofEurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will nolonger be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, thespokesman said.    Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most havematurities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, thespokesman said.    He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have anadverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the generaldecline in interest rates means they will be able to refinanceat lower interest rates.    However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be facedwith lower yields.;interest

""There should be another month or two of very weak new homesales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homesshould become more stable by mid-summer,"" said economistLawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.    The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the CommerceDepartment said.    Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out atabout 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.    The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers outof the market, he and others said.

""They were so startled, they wanted tohold back and see what would happen.""    The drop in sales of new single-family home sales wassharper than expected, some economists said.

"UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES<AUTHOR>    by Patricia Campbell, Reuters</AUTHOR>    CHICAGO, June 19 - The six basis point rise of the pastmonth in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by aseries of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as thedollar holds firm.    ""Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basispoints over the last month, largely over indications thatinflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowingU.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,"" Samuel Kahan, chieffinancial economist with Kleinwort Benson GovernmentSecurities, said.    Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength inthe economy during the first quarter, but his concern iswhether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in thelonger term.    Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which hasbecome more important to the direction of debt futures than thebeneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.    The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. ConsumerPrice Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down1.5 pct, respectively.    Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 moneysupply announced this week was ""surprising, much larger thanexpected,"" according to Kahan. ""Unless quickly reversed,"" sucha trend ""will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,""Kahan said.    Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates whichKahan said have ""slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Boardannual targets,"" the consequences could be a hint of economicweakness down the road, he said.    Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised forfurther gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,analysts said.    September T-bonds ""are up almost six points since about May18,"" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. Septemberbond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93in mid-June, Duggan said.    While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide throughchart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwartedabove the 93 level.    ""The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be takenout before this activity is anything other than a trading rangemarket,"" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analystBrian Singer said.    The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.    ""The critical variable remaining in the market is the valueof the dollar,"" Kahan said.    Additional influences next week will be possibledevelopments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impactand size of the U.S. budget deficit, ""although these will notbe in the forefront of the market early next week,"" Kahan said.

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING<AUTHOR>    By Peter Bale, Reuters</AUTHOR>    SYDNEY, April 8 - Australian markets are booming as foreignfund managers redirect capital away from the United States andother traditional markets, analysts said.    High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market andan increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow offresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese andU.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.    Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash inand have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as theydiversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.    A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates inthe past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for thecurrency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.    Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capitalare not available, but brokers said they received almost dailyinquiries from Japan and the United States.    ""These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing aboutand they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is endingup here with the attraction of high interest rates andreasonable currency stability,"" National Australia Bank Ltdeconomist Brian Hamley said.    ""There is a 'flight to quality',"" Hamley said. ""Australia maynot be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't toomany other countries where you'd want to put your money.""    The stronger Australian dollar was also attractinginvestors taking advantage of an appreciating currency againstthe volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.    ""We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.Where some people would be concerned about the value of theU.S. Dollar,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrosesaid. ""Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheapand the currency looks stable?""    But turning that capital into more permanent productiveinvestment depends on government economic policy, he said.    ""It will only disappear if people lose confidence in thedirection in the economy,"" Buttrose said, adding that offshoreinvestors would carefully watch the government's promised tougheconomic statement on May 14.    While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yieldinginterest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just aseasily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who werebadly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollarand hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.    ""It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to bedelivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, onemight see a substantial outflow,"" Buttrose said.    Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tougheconomic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt andstubborn current account deficit, analysts said.    ""They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I thinkthey would like to leave the money here,"" Buttrose said.    Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increasedinterest in investment in Australia and the need to shieldJapanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.    Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged anelement of targeting the rate against the yen in currencypolicy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes offthe yen"" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.    Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had workedsuccessfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollarwithin the range of 100 to 103 yen.    Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, theAustralian dollar has also risen almost three pct on atrade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.    Offshore buying has also played a role in the boomingAustralian share market. It has followed Wall Street and othermarkets, but is also setting its own trend in response to theweight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring intoequities, particularly in the gold sector.    The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, whilethe gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in thesame period.    The property sector is also sought after, with Japanesecompanies that have invested heavily in the United States inrecent years turning their attention to undervalued realestate, particularly in the tourism field.    Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-starRegent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrsas indicative of the type of property being sought.    ""They think they find good value real estate here which,with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind ofinvestment Australia needs,"" Buttrose added.";interest

"DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY<AUTHOR>    By Marcel Michelson, Reuters</AUTHOR>    AMSTERDAM, June 1 - A cut of about half a percentage pointin Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, althougheconomists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and widepremiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advancesrate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped itsrepurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.    That rate has remained in force, just holding above thefive pct official secured loans rate which governs commercialbank borrowings.    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West Germanrepo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate tothree pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered moneymarket rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loansrate on lending under its three month credit quota.    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and FinanceMinistry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said hewould follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the FinanceMinistry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billionguilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pctfor an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a differencebetween the secured loans rate which applies to lending underthe credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which addextra liquidity to the money market.    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move tofurther lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts wouldresult in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around itsparity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673guilders per 100 marks.    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a levelthat would not permit a change in the interest ratedifferential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealerssaid.    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German andDutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, hesaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflationexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest ratesin the longer term.    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,or even negative, while the latest official economic forecastspoint to a falling rate of economic growth.    ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreementnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""the ABN economist said.    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct inJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run totwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in thesecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buyingspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall belowfive pct.

While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbankpresident Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also addedmoney market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want astrong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.     ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew inLondon.    But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken oneof the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the WestGermans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05percentage point.""    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tighteningof West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall andfuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.    Six leading industrial nations agreed under February'sLouvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetarypolicies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.    The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency marketsand the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours tradingin New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar wasquoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.    Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at DeutscheGenossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on worldstock markets had been the main reason for the fall in WestGerman short-term interest rates on Tuesday.    ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock marketlosses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fitswith Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.    No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and theBundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following risesin the U.S., Aschoff said.    Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the centralbank has no interest in higher capital market rates and hethought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.    Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First BostonLtd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreatand Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as thesecurity repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it wasbefore the IMF meeting last month in Washington.""    Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord wasreaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidityat 3.60 pct, Keating noted.    Economists said the United States now appeared to haveagreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and supportthe dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.    Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinderWashington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenbergtold a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not ruleout central banks of leading industrial countries interveningon exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.    Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed WestGermany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currencystability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German centralbanks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force themto again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.";interest

GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS    FRANKFURT, April 9 - Remarks by central bankers raised somehopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchasepacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of amove in the near term, money market dealers said.    Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterdaythat rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth fromspeculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state centralbank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lowerlimit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.    Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but thedrop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.    Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotmentthis week dashed some hopes of lower rates.    The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday innew liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.    But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by thepact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.    The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates onrepurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.    Bundesbank officials have already said they favour morediscreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather thanthe more public adjustment of leading rates.    The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate andallow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the casesince it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it mayallow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.    Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.    Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.This should then flow back into the market as it is depositedwith banks.    Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.    Holdings of average daily reserves over the first sevendays of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above theestimated 51 billion required for all of April.;interest

"NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, June 2 - Bundesbank vice president HelmutSchlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.    With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down inMay and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that afurther cut in interest rates was needed.    The economy is picking up, after contracting by aseasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter fromthe fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp startingin the second quarter,"" he said in an interview.    Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has beenpressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost itsimports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.    Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter wasmainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.    He estimated that economic growth for the year as a wholewould probably be between one and two pct.   ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domesticdemand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interestrates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.    Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank moneystock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year paceof 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to sixpct target.    He said the target could still be achieved but much willdepend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavyinflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMSrevaluation, boosted domestic money supply.    ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow offoreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bitreversed,"" Schlesinger said.    A major reason for the inflows was the market's convictionthat the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market,expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark havediminished,"" Schlesinger said.    The recent widening of interest rate differentials, thefact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short periodand an improvement in real trade balances have all combinedtowards stabilizing the dollar, he said.    Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollarrise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.    At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.    ""Central banks are always in contact about thesefluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,""Schelsinger said.    ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the Americancase.""    He said that the West German export industry has been hithard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to seesome correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-termfluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see.""    ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a veryshort period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level(of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said.    The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices ofsuch key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on WestGerman inflation down year.    Although there have recently been signs of inflationpicking up, he said that this was due to changes in keycommodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year wouldbe unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.    Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growthwas longer term, in that the economy was building up thepotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.    The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness oftargets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at themid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.    But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go awayfrom it.""";interest

"LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES    WASHINGTON, April 9 - Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interestrates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.    Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Sevencountries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he saidcentral banks would continue to intervene ""as and whennecessary.""    He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do moreto stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined byJapanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.    Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of asimultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and WestGermany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budgetspeech to the British Parliament.    ""If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there isstill a risk,"" he said.    Asked if the United States should consider increasinginterest rates to support the dollar, he said, ""If there is aneed for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need tobe a rise in interest rates in the United States.""    Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday'smeetings at the slow progress the United States had made inreducing its budget deficit.    ""We believe there will be some worthwhile progress inreducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that itcontinue year after year,"" Lawson said.    The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts tostabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the sixweeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise againstthe dollar despite massive central bank intervention.    Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness inthe Louvre accord, he said, ""I don't think so. If there had beenno intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.""    Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawsonsaid, ""the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode... but one has to be vigilant.""    He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that""current levels"" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been""carefully worded."" ""We know what we mean, and we all mean thesame thing,"" he said.    Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanesemeasures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source ofweakness for that agreement.    Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa'spresentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulatedomestic demand.    They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediateincrease in public works spending, but Lawson said the packagealso involved a second stage to increase expenditures duringthe second half of this year.";interest
"ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE<AUTHOR>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 9 - Economists said that they doubt theFederal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despitehigher discount window borrowings in the latest two-weekstatement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.    Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mlndlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.    ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but itprobably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.    Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policymodestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in thetwo-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averagingaround 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.    However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latesttwo-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demandoften pushes up borrrowings.    ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but itlooks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisionslate in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" saidWard McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today thatthe Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs ormore in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.    Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss inits estimates over the week that caused it to add fewerreserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.    The Fed took no market reserve management action lastThursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It addedtemporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs ofcustomer repurchase agreements and then supplied reservesdirectly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that thetwo-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged onTuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday'sovernight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.    ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy atthis time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.    Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzisaid the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interestrates to help the dollar because that would harm already weakeconomies in the United States and abroad and add to thefinancial stress of developing countries and their lenders.    ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the lateststatement period have to explain why it acted before the dollartumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.    He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a newstatement period began today on disappointment yesterday'sWashington meetings of international monetary officials failedto produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.    In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing inWednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view thatthe yen needs to rise further to redress the huge tradeimbalance between the United States and Japan.    The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming forsteady policy now that should correspond to a weekly averageFed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about wherethe rate has been since early November.    ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighterpolicy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan ofDean Witter.    If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has justnudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct fromsix to 6.10 pct previously.";interest

These moves to cap interest rates followed a meetingbetween Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.    Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmedtheir commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.    Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening inWest German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of thedollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.    But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting innervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.    Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was notdue to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, andcurrency developments.    Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said ""Youhave to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue apolicy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears."" The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, hesaid.    Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution tointernational cooperation in interest and monetary policy.    The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its moneysupply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.    ""Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interestrates have risen substantially more,"" Poehl said.    This had to be taken into account when considering recentrises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due torising international money market rates that had spilled overinto the German market, he said.    Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so farignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.    ""The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance isdefinitely underway,"" he said, noting that this was not sonoticeable in absolute figures.    The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had alsoattracted little attention, he said.";interest

"U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, June 18 - Today's U.K. Economic data have pushedthe chances of another base lending rate cut from the currentnine pct further into the distance, analysts said.    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturingproduction data showed that the economy is still strong anddoes not need a fillip from lower rates.    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,taken together with higher than expected bank lending and moneysupply growth, revived inflation worries and monetaristarguments against easier credit, they said.    ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed backall the while. The strength of the economy and broad moneygrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the nearterm,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday'smortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societiessaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.Rates.    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week thata post-general election cut was imminent, supported by suchoptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise whichmirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling'sstrength.    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasmabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidlyreplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlyingaverage earnings in April, dealers said.    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lendingrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bankof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offsetthe impact on domestic money supply of its currentintervention.    ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.    ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a verygood state indeed,"" Skeoch said.    ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationarypressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost riseswere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year toApril, and it was these costs rather than average earningswhich were potentially inflationary, he added.    ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a majorproblem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worriedabout the funding implications of recent intervention.    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assetsearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes thatthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, nowlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities tryto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort GrievesonSecurities, said any fresh sterling strength would stilltrigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signalhigher inflation this year.    ""Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. Aslong as that continues we're okay,"" he added.";interest

JAPAN HAS NO PLANS TO CUT DISCOUNT RATE    WASHINGTON, April 9 - Bank of Japan sources said the bankhas no plans to cut its discount rate.    They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japanduring the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lowerits discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feelany need for a cut at all.    Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reportersearlier today that some countries - those with strongcurrencies - might have to cut interest rates.    The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon tocall the G-7 pact a failure.    The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar'srenewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked byremarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that thedollar's fall had been orderly.    They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker'scomments because he was referring to the dollar's fall sincethe Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,not the currency's recent movements.    They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seizeon anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way orthe other.    The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting moreweight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging marketstability than on other currencies.    Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangersthat would arise from a further dollar fall because it wouldreduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting theU.S. And world economies, they said.    In February and in March of this year, Japanese investorsreduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sourcessaid.    Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view aboutcurrency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.    This is because the overall foreign exchange market is atriangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen anddollar/European currencies.

"U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, June 2 - The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for afurther cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11general election, market analysts said.    Sterling would have risen on the much better than expectednumber but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.    But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves nowavailable to the authorities to support the pound should curbany market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show theruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.    ""We have been intervening to a very much greater extent thanwe have done hitherto,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid at a news conference today, commenting on the news of therecord reserves rise.    He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvreaccord between leading industrial nations to stabilise thedollar, partly through direct intervention on foreignexchanges. ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" hesaid.    But market analysts see the recent upward pressure onsterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp downits rise, more in the light of local factors.    Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britainamid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears lastautumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.    U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreignbuyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields asattractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notablyequities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.    Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lowerinterest rates, as the government is expected to try to reversethe loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.    Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reservesnews, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket ofcurrencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.    ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of theelection,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.    Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts ofa rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs hadoverestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely tohave been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on theforward market.    The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount ofsterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooththe pound's sudden downturn, while some of the interventionreported in May probably occurred in April, they said.    The key three months interbank money market rates easedabout 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrendin U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reservesnews, analysts said.    Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market wasmuted as traders worried about the funding implications ofanother huge rise in reserves, they added.    Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cutfrom the current nine pct level soon after the election, solong as poll projections of another Conservative victory proveaccurate, with another half point later.    Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit SuisseBuckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might bepossible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts infuture, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted.    Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautionedagainst over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cutlooked likely.    A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.    ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the politicalproblem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... Andhas signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said RobinMarshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.    He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves inthe past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into theEuropean Monetary System.    But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they didso. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.";interest

Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buyback securities pledged on May 6.    Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today asan earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectivelywithdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market withtoday's allocation.    A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that thewithdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of creditpolicy, but was to be seen in the context of plentifulliquidity in the banking system.    Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbankover the first six days of the month, well clear of the likelyApril minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.    The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banksthemselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.

"SOUTH KOREA TO CHANGE POLICIES TO AVERT TRADE WAR<AUTHOR>    By Moon Ihlwan, Reuters</AUTHOR>    SEOUL, April 17 - South Korea has decided on major changesin its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducingthe growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding atrade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister KimMahn-je said.    Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exportscould make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase&#127;nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, whichmeans abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreigndebt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.    Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said thecurrent account surplus, previously expected to exceed eightbillion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billiondlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisationand rationalising exports.    He said Seoul would try to limit its current accountsurplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next fewyears, although trade volume would continue to grow.    ""This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP(gross national product) from the current five pct level tothree pct by 1991,"" he added.    Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreigndebt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the endof 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5billion dlrs at end-1986.    ""But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected toremain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lowerthan the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,"" he said.    The policy change was announced two days before thescheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrigefor talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.    South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateraltrade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.    Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swingin South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billiondlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mlndlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.    The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, rawmaterials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.    ""The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), areconsiderable incentives given to increase imports,"" Koo said.    Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency.""It means they could become interest-free loans if the Koreancurrency continues to rise in value,"" he said.    He said the South Korean won would be revalued against thedollar gradually, but added ""We do not believe in rapid one-shotchanges in the value of the won.""

"OECD SEES GERMAN GROWTH HIT BY LOW DOMESTIC DEMAND    PARIS, June 19 - West German economic growth will slow to1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domesticdemand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisationfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in itssemi-annual review of the world economy.    This view is less favourable than the West Germangovernment's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct thisyear, but is in line with forecasts by independent economicinstitutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.    The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,with the gross national product rising by two pct in realterms.    The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passingthrough a period of temporary weakness and there would be somerecovery in business confidence in the near future.    But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economywas higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.    While noting that the government is bringing forward a fivebillion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that ""themedium to longer-term performance of the West German economycould be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allowrelatively lower tax rates.""

"S.KOREA CURRENT A/C SURPLUS SEEN NEAR 10 BLN DLRS    SEOUL, Oct 19 - South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billiondlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for thecountry's cheap cars and electronic goods.    Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny theYonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its ownfigures later in the week.    Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the currentaccount, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled7.03 billion dlrs.    This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for thewhole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks withthe International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapidrevaluation of the won against the dollar.    The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.    ""Exports in October could be relatively modest due to manypublic holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus willbe well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,"" Yonhap said.    The sharp rise in the September surplus came from aresumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previousmonth.    More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrestbetween July and September.    The South Korean government originally targeted a fivebillion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raisethis to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half exportboom.

"INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY    BONN, April 13 - The five leading West German economicresearch institutes have failed to agree about how strongly thedomestic economy will expand this year but revised downforecasts contained in a report published six months ago.    The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essenpredicted in the institutes' joint spring report that grossnational product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, comparedwith 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecastthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlinand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.    The joint report said that the estimates of economicdevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly lessfavourable"" than those of the other three.    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after aslow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will,however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said.    The two institutes said external economic factors whichwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports woulddominate the economic environment throughout the year. They sawexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted nomarked improvement in the course of the year.    The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline indemand and production (seen) in the winter months does notindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.""    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporateuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.But they expected that many investments had not been cancelledbut only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.""    They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuationof the economic uptrend are still favourable.""    These three institutes said diminishing external burdenscombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn indemand and production could be expected by the spring.    However, this projection was clouded by risks including thefurther development of the mark against the dollar.    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said thatwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of theeconomy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exportswill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge duringthe course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fallin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.    The three more positive institutes saw private consumptionrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving butpredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline inunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said thejobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people inwork of about 200,000.    These three institutes said new jobs would be createdmainly in the private services sector and also by the state inthe context of job creation measures. The construction industrywas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980but they predicted either no rise in employment in themanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur onlyin the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in themanufacturing industry will decline.""    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw acurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marksand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start torise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all fivepredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.";bop
"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST CUT SPENDING, ANZ SAYS    SYDNEY, April 13 - The government must announce harsh cutsin spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to givean adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZBanking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> said.    Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against thebackdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthlyBusiness Indicators publication.    ""For the past two years, the government has struggled withan economic reality that demands measures beyond those which itsees as politically practicable,"" it said.    The political climate meant there would be a continuedover-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate andmaintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.    ""The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revivalof business investment will be further postponed,"" it said.    The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted byexport and import-replacement industries which had created afalse suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance ofpayments crisis were past.

""It has to depend on public sector investment forfaster growth if the private sector is not moving.""    Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinkingone pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.    The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be undertwo pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pctbecause prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin andsemiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.    The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billionringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.    Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pctin 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.    Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmenblaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.    One businessman said too many politicians give theimpression that Malaysia was unstable.

The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congressquickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit ""could seriouslyaffect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.""    It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,running until September 30 this year, would substantiallyovershoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billiondlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.    ""The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions ofslower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for thefirst half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190billion dollars,"" it said.    While this would be 30 billion lower than last year'sdeficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate taxincreases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.    The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.    In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exportsboosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.    Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the servicesector continues to create jobs.

"PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS<AUTHOR>    By Pascal Fletcher, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LISBON, April 13 - Portugal's economy, which has beenenjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latestgovernment crisis, analysts said.    But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal CavacoSilva's government could slow economic reforms and investmentas Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the EuropeanCommunity, which it joined in January last year, they said.    Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, wastoppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.    The centre-right administration had made economic growthreform a priority in its 17 months in office.    In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its currentaccount surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs andinflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.    Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instabilitywere worrying but they felt the foundations for continuedgrowth had not been badly shaken.    ""The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that isnow less dependent on the political situation,"" said FritzHaser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.    ""The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,"" economistJorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.    Businessmen have identified political instability over thelast 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lastingeconomic progress.    The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974revolution.    Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remainbuoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surgein economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largelyunderpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.    Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank ofPortugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growthwould remain at similar levels this year.    But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policiesand could slow economic development.    Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the endof the month, can either call early elections or form a newgovernment from parties in the existing left wing-dominatedparliament.    Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quickelections as the best solution. ""There is a good chance that amajority government could result from early elections,""Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president PedroFerraz da Costa said.    He said they were optimistic this could mean thecontinuation in the near future of liberalisation policiesintroduced over the last year.    The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, butthe PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion pollssay they could win an overall majority.    A PSD majority would also open the way for morewide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws andpossible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.    Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition partiesof blocking key economic reforms.    The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic resultswere more the product of favourable international conditionssuch as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSDpolicies.";bop

An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall toslightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed torestructure their economies.    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cutJapan's current account surplus to two pct of gross nationalproduct (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a changewould slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annuallyduring the seven-year period to 1993.    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollarwould remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan'scurrent-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993.

He told a press conference the government planned toincrease investment, speed up the opening of the local marketto foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to holdthe surplus ""at a proper level.""    But he said the government would not allow the won toappreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea hasbeen under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.    The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus withthe U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3billion dlrs in 1985.    Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospectswere bright for the South Korean economy, but the governmentwould try to hold the current account surplus to around fivebillion dlrs a year for the next five years.    ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, fivebillion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth inexports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But nowthe surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said.    Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of thisyear, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.    Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to asurplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlrdeficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled thecountry to reduce its foreign debt last year for the firsttime.    South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrsin 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largestin Asia.    ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of themajor constraints on our development... Last year was a majorturning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said.

""The government, however, does not want to acceleratereducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" hesaid.    Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflationand lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,particularly the United States.

"JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD    PARIS, June 18 - Japan's trade surplus is likely tocontinue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroadincrease while domestic demand remains sluggish, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)said.    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, theOECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus lastyear, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 whileexport markets rose by only two pct.    But it said this differential between the growth ofdomestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over twopct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pctin 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 willrise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billionyen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demandand increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said themeasures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quitepossibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects haveworked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.    The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current accountsurpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantialnet external asset position could well lead to upward pressureon the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then leadmanufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thusweaken domestic growth.

"OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD    SINGAPORE, June 29 - OPEC has shown itself to be in controlof the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out apact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day(bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.    They said market respect for the cartel has increased sinceit announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter outputto 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.    ""There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensuredthere will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is ineffect putting pressure on end-users,"" a European crude oiltrader said.    In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, ""There's no reason to expecta weak market from now on.""    A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, ""Wethought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarterproduction so the market will react very bullishly.""    Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only aslight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmarkcrude, they expect price increases over the next few days.    August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity ataround 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but stillbelow the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.    Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and AbuDhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weakpositions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traderssaid sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.    They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices tostabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.    They said the Japanese oil market would be most affectedand Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winterrequirements before October.    Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter onEuropean and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.    ""There's no doubt consumption will be higher than productionby the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,"" said aninternational trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was lessbullish, ""For sure there will be some shortage but it depends onhow much they (OPEC members) cheat.""    A Singapore trade source said, ""There is enough cheating andleakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there isno need to worry about shortages.""    Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearishfactor to be considered.    Traders also said end-users now would buy as much aspossible on term contracts and buy spot only when the marketcooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.    Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed inthin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillatesquiet on minimal buying interest.

"LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS    New York, June 1 - The elimination of limits on daily pricefluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on theCommodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effecton the market, analysts said.    ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said WilliamO'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.    ""The market has not approached the old price limits andtrading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he said.    On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the twocontracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copperand aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,which were severely tested by a volatile market in silverfutures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the liftingof all daily limits, effective today.    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs perounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in thenearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.    Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most backmonths, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearbycontracts amid quiet trading today.    During the last week of April, silver futures often tradedat the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, thedollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, orunlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.    As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, manyunmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.    The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrsfor failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panicbuying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.    O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits wouldadd caution to trading.    ""This is a more realistic approach because the metalsmarket is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""O'Neill said.";alum

Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner FransAndriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.    He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposalsfor a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would bedefeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.    Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax wasadopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,they would be compensated through access to the EC foralternative exports.    ""Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannotsee how this would work out in our case,"" Lim said.    Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250mln dlrs a year.    The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPCmeeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.

 EURODOLLAR BONDS CLOSE LOWER<AUTHOR>    By Norma Cohen, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, April 9 - Eurodollar bonds closed as much as a fullpoint lower as the dollar fell to a post-war low against theyen and interest rates on U.S. Treasuries rose almost to eightpct.    The dollar fell to 144.30 yen and recovered only slightlyafter foreign exchange traders in New York said the FederalReserve intervened to buy dollars for yen.    But despite the dollar's woes, Japan Development Bank,wholly owned by the Japanese government, raised 150 mln dlrs ina seven-year eurobond carrying an eight pct coupon.    Lead manager for the issue, Bank of Tokyo, said the deal,at the time of pricing, was to yield 60 basis points overcomparable maturity Treasuries. However, by the close oftrading, that spread had narrowed to 55 and continued to slidein aftermarket activity.    Dealers noted that the spread to Treasuries is wide for anewly-priced AAA-rated borrower like Japan Development Bank.For example, earlier this week, the World Bank raised U.S. Dlrsat only 25 basis points over Treasuries. Dealers said thatbecause the borrower comes to market fairly infrequently -- thelast time was about nine months ago, the spread appears wide.    But officials at Bank of Tokyo said the spread is intendedto compensate for the lack of liquidity and for the uncertaintycurrently associated with owning dollar securities.    The officials said the borrower opted to raise funds indollars, despite the currency's weakness, because it is theonly market deep enough to accommodate an issue of that size.Japan Development Bank is not allowed to raise euroyen.    Market sources said the deal is likely to be swapped intoyen as the borrowers previous issues were.    Late in the day, the deal was trading just inside its feesat less 1.75 less 1.55.    Also issued today was a 40 mln dlr five-year offering fromToshiba International Finance (Netherlands) carrying a 7-3/8pct coupon and priced at 101-1/2.    Three equity linked dollar denominated deals were offered,the largest of which was a 200 mln dlr offering by SekisuiChemical Co and guaranteed by Sanwa Bank Ltd. The issue hasequity warrants attached and late in the day it was quoted onbrokers' screens at 106-1/2, bid only.    The Australian dollar market continued active, withCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce offering a bond of 125 mlnfive-year with a zero coupon priced at 54.    Late in the day, the deal was quoted at less 1-1/4 bid. Asimilar deal yesterday by Toronto Dominion, priced slightlyhigher at 54.37 pct for an effective yield of 13.52 pct, wasquoted slightly lower at less 1.37 less 1.25 pct.    Dealers said that investors are apparently willing toaccept zero-coupon bonds yielding 50 to 100 basis points lessthan annual-pay bonds because their are tax benefits for retailbuyers. Also, the bonds are more volatile and if interest ratesfall in Australia as many analysts expect, the potential forcapital gains is greater with a zero-coupon. The bonds are alsobetter for those who expect the australian dlr to appreciate.    Dealers said that the Australia dlr zero coupon bonds areapparently being placed with retail accounts on the Europeancontinent with very little placement being done in Japan.    Euroyen issues sank slightly in line with prices ondomestic Japanese bond markets but recovered in late trade asthe yen soared. After the markets closed, the dollar fell to144 yen.    The European Investment Bank (EIB) issued a 40 mln euroyenissue paying 4-5/8 pct over seven years. This is the secondseven-year yen issue in two days -- a sector of the yield curvein Japan that dealers feel has not yet become overpriced.;unknown

" AGREE ON NEW PROSPECTUS RULES FOR NOTES<AUTHOR>    By Peter Conradi</AUTHOR>    ZURICH, April 9 - Swiss franc notes issued after May 1 mustbe provided with a prospectus, virtually erasing the differencein information requirements between notes and public bonds,according to a convention drafted by the Bankers' Federation.    The convention requires that lead managers draw up aprospectus naming all syndicate members and providing certaindetails about the borrower.    In contrast to public issues, though, the prospectus mustmerely be made available to clients on request via allsyndicate banks rather than published and distributed inprinted form.    The convention, which was approved by banks earlier thismonth, replaces an earlier convention dating from 1984 anddeals with what had been widely seen as an increasinglyanachronistic distinction between notes and public issues.    Its publication follows a long debate among bankers on theamount of information that should be provided by borrowers,heightened by difficulties with Swiss franc issues here onrecent occasions .    It applies to all notes in units of at least 50,000 Swissfrancs, the usual denomination, which are placed directly withcustomers by the syndicate and not quoted on the bourse.    Anything smaller than 50,000 francs will be governed by theunchanged, more demanding rules that apply to public issues.    Bankers contacted by Reuters said they did not envisagethat the new requirement would present them with problems orpush up fees. Many banks said that they had for some time beenproviding more than the legal minimum of information.    Traditionally, notes or private placements, as they werealso known, were medium term instruments denominated in 50,000francs and placed largely with institutional investors.    They were normally not brought onto the open market andnever quoted on the stock exchange.    But over the years the distinction between notes and thepublicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down. TheNational Bank therefore last May abolished all remainingrestrictions on maturities and denominations which stillformally divided them.    However, it was not in the competence of the National Bankto rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largelyas before: public issues, generally quoted on stock exchanges,have been provided with detailed prospectuses, while notes,virtually always not-quoted, have been equipped only with""information memorandums"" with varying degrees of detail.    The new convention attempts to put an end to this. It sayseach notes prospectus must contain the following seven points:    - The precise terms of the issue    - Details of the company performance if it is more than sixmonths since the last annual report    - Naming of all guarantors    - The source of the information    - Details of ratings, insofar as they have been made    - For equity linked notes, details of where the company'sshares are listed and price high and lows over at least thelast three years.    - That the lead manager has required the borrower toprovide information during the lifetime of the notes on theprogress of his business.     According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp, total noteissues by foreign borrowers reached 18.6 billion Swiss francslast year, compared with 23.6 billion francs borrowed in theform of public bonds.    A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers.";unknown

" CAPITAL MARKET LIBERALIZATION STALLS<AUTHOR>    By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters</AUTHOR>    FRANKFURT, April 13 - West Germany's capital marketliberalization program has stalled and bankers are worried itmay take years for further reforms to be completed.    Liberalization got underway in May 1985 when foreign banksreceived Bundesbank permission to lead-manage mark eurobonds.    Further moves included introduction of mark-denominatedcertificates of deposit last year. But other changes, includingrevisions in the domestic options market and introduction offutures contracts, need lengthy statutory changes and this maytake years, bankers and dealers say.    Deutsche Bank AG co-chairman F. Wilhelm Christians calledlast week for an enlargement of current capital marketinstruments to include instruments already standard abroad.    He said these are needed especially when prices fall,citing declines in West German share prices in the first twomonths of this year when stock indices fell about 20 pct.    Others are more blunt. Securities dealers say the lack ofviable hedging instruments for shares and bonds makes tradingin domestic markets too risky.    ""We need a stock index futures contract, and a futurescontract for recent government bonds,"" one dealer said.    West Germany now has options contracts on about five pct ofshares and bonds traded on exchanges here, covering only about30 pct of the average traded volume, stock market sources said.    Options can only be written on the original 14 bondsselected when bond options were introduced last April. The mostrecent bond on the list was issued in 1985.    There are no futures exchanges in West Germany. Germanbanks may participate in futures exchanges through branchesabroad but these are at least outwardly subject to stringentWest German rules requiring that every contract be secured on aone-by-one basis with a separate hedge, to prevent speculation.    Another problem is a lack of liquidity in the existingmarkets, owing to lack of private investor participation.    Private individuals and corporations do not engage inoptions trading now due to West Germany's civil and exchangelaws, which define losses made in futures and options businessas gambling losses, which investors need not pay back.    Options business has been hurt by lack of liquidity frompension funds, which currently are forbidden to invest in theseinstruments. But they are to be allowed to enter the businesssoon as the European Community begins to harmonize rulesgoverning funds.    Manfred Laux, general secretary of the West German mutualfunds association in Frankfurt, said harmonized rules are to beadopted by October 1, 1989 at the latest.    The push to adopt new instruments has not been great in thepast, owing to wide-spread belief they are speculative, whichgives them a bad name in West Germany. But pressure for theirintroduction here is growing.    The start-up of a Swiss futures exchange has some bankersconsidering if a similar exchange would be useful in WestGermany. They say that without innovations, some business coulddrift to London, which the Bundesbank vehemently opposes.    An official at the London International Financial FuturesExchange (LIFFE) said the exchange currently has no plans tointroduce more mark-denominated contracts beyond the existingmark-dollar contract. But he said the exchange is studying thefeasibility of other contracts, including one for three-monthmark interest rates and possibly a government bond contract.    A Bundesbank capital markets expert said the Bundesbank hasno objections to hedging through futures but any liberalizationin that sector is still in the early planning stages afterearlier talks ended two years ago.    Considerations about the futures business have been drawnout because of the large number of participants involved intalks. They include parliament, the Bundesbank, the FederalBanking Supervisory Board, eight West German stock exchangesand their governing states, and the four West German bankingassociations.    Beyond options and futures, other changes being suggestedinclude replacing the federal government's current bondconsortium with an auction procedure similar to one beingconsidered in the U.K. And already in practice in the U.S.    This would upset the existing market order providing Germanand foreign banks in the consortium with fixed quotas but itwould eliminate the misallocations some bankers say presentlyarise within the fixed consortium quota system.    In addition, some bankers would like the method of bondtrading on the West German stock exchange changed to a systemof continuous price-setting from the current system in whichevery bond price is fixed once a day.    This would make trading more transparent if it reduced theproportion of off-floor interbank bond trading, now some 90 pctof the volume of bond transactions here, the bankers say.";unknown

 BANK SUSPENDS LOANS TO PERU - CENTRAL BANK<AUTHOR>    By Walker Simon, Reuters</AUTHOR>     LIMA, June 2 - The World Bank has suspended loans to Perubecause the country has over two months of payment arrears withthe lending agency, central bank general manager Hector Neyrasaid.     He told reporters the government decided to stop payingthe World Bank because scheduled repayments outweighed theloans it was due to receive.     The measure was the latest hard-line debt stance adoptedby the government of President Alan Garcia, one of LatinAmerica's most delinquent debtors. The 22-month-oldadministration has cut repayments to 10 pct of export earningson nearly all its 14.4 billion dlr foreign debt.     Neyra said since late 1986 Peru had sought an accomodationwith the World Bank under which it would receive more creditsthan it would remit in repayments.     Neyra stressed Peru was not withdrawing from the worldbank. The country had recently increased its capitalsuscription in the institution by about three mln dollars.    The Bank would immediately resume loan disbursements toPeru once it cleared its arrears, he said. He did not specifythe value of the overdue payments. The economy ministry saidPeru's debt to the world bank was 521 mln dlrs at end-1985.    At the end of last year, Peru's total foreign debt stood at14.46 billion dollars, 13.17 billion dollars of which ismedium- and-long-term debt, the central bank said. Totalarrears were 5.42 billion dollars.    Central bank president Leonel Figueroa said Peru had enoughhard currency, gold and silver on hand to cover 10 or 11months' worth of imports.    The holdings of the two precious metals and the hardcurrencies were valued at 2.172 billion dlrs on May 22, 1987,he said.    Gross reserves were slightly lower at 1.857 billion dlrsbecause this classification did not include silver holdings andundervalued the central bank's gold.

" TRY TO CALM MANILA'S FURY OVER DEBT DEAL<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 17 - Senior U.S. bankers are seeking tocalm the furore in the Philippines caused by the terms ofArgentina's new financing package, but a source in New Yorkclose to the Manila government said finance minister JaimeOngpin is in no mood for compromise.    Ongpin is angry because the banks granted Argentina aninterest rate spread of 13/16 pct, the same as Mexico won, justweeks after telling the Philippines that it must accept 7/8 pctbecause the Mexican margin could never be repeated.    Bankers acknowledged the political sensitivity of theinterest spread but urged Ongpin to examine the Argentinepackage in its entirety.    Argentina, for instance, is offering banks a 3/8 pctparticipation fee if they sign up for the deal within 30 days(declining to 1/8 pct if banks commit within 60 days), whichboosts the all-in interest rate it is paying on the package.    ""You can make the case that the deal is not 13/16 pct,"" onebanker said. Another, referring to the Philippine debtnegotiators, said ""The only reason they'd have to come back toNew York is political, not economic.""    Ongpin has said as much himself, estimating that an extra1/16 percentage point would cost just 5.1 mln dlrs a year.    But the source close to the Philippines said Ongpin's angergoes beyond the dollars. He said the minister feels personallybetrayed by bankers who insisted Mexico's 13/16 pct was arock-bottom spread that could not be duplicated. Top U.S.Treasury and Federal Reserve officials had said the same.    The source said Ongpin is unlikely to come to the U.S. topress his case and was expecting the Philippines' bank advisorycommittee, headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co, tonegotiate the spread reduction by telex.    Ongpin has not said the Philippines will unilaterally startpaying interest at the lower rate but has made it clear to thecommittee in a telex that he is not prepared to pay more thanMexico and Argentina, the source said.    ""The Philippines really means business on this. I don'tthink there's much room for compromise,"" he said.    Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the issue.    The Philippines last month won an agreement to reschedule10.3 billion dlrs of debt over 17 years at an interest rate of7/8 pct, whereas some 30 billion dlrs in old Argentine debtwill be stretched out over 19 years with a spread of 13/16 pct.    Bankers said they were forced to break their word becausepolitical circumstances had changed in the past few weeks.    In particular, they said it had become clear that Argentinawas serious about its threat to suspend interest paymentsunless it got a good deal. Fearing that an Argentine moratoriumwould stiffen the resolve of its neighbour Brazil, which hasalready suspended payments, the banks, at the urging of theReagan Administration, bowed to Argentina's demands.    Some U.S. bankers argued that, regardless of politics, therich menu of options in the Argentine package makes itattractive enough to justify a 13/16 pct rescheduling rate.    ""When they (the Philippines) see the whole package, theymay realize that this is not a Mexican deal,"" one banker saidof the Argentine agreement.    The Argentine pact contains several features that were notin the Mexican accord such as ""exit bonds,"" an option toprovide new money via bearer bonds, a trade facility, onlendingprovisions and a debt-equity conversion scheme.    Moreover, Argentina is requesting only 1.95 billion dlrs innew loans, compared with Mexico's 7.7 billion, and is paying7/8 pct for most of the money instead of the 13/16 pct chargedto Mexico.    This line of argument cuts no ice with the Filipinos, whonote drily that they asked for no new money at all.    ""The banks reacted on the level of politics to Argentinaand try to justify it in terms of economics, and now they'regoing to have problems with both the Philippines andVenezuela,"" said the source close to the Manila government.    Because of the Easter holidays bankers have not yet got anofficial reaction from Venezuela, which is also paying 7/8 pcton its 20.2 billion dlr rescheduling. But they acknowledgedthat Caracas, which was also told that the Mexico spread wasinviolate, is quite likely to demand a lower spread.    Bankers were more sanguine in the case of Chile.    Because it is under fire for its human-rights record, thegovernment of General Augusto Pinochet is unlikely to attractattention to itself by seeking to renegotiate its recent debtpackage, which carries interest of one pct, bankers said.    They hope that, once tempers cool, the Philippines willalso accept that reopening an agreement that took 4-1/2 toughmonths to negotiate will be more trouble than it is worth.";unknown

" GILTS DEALERS NEED NOT BUY AT AUCTIONS    LONDON, April 13 - Primary dealers in U.K. Government giltswill not be required to underwrite the government's offering ofits securities when the first auctions begin in Mid-May, theBank of England said.    In an official notice released today, the Bank said ""Therewill be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for theauctions but the Bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers,as part of their commitment to the market, to participateactively in the auction process.""    The Bank was originally believed to have favoured requiringthe dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned afterthose in the U.S. Treasury market.    However, the Treasury was believed to have baulked at therequest by the 27 market makers for an allotment commissionwhich would discourage the largest institutional investors fromplacing orders for new stock directly through the Bank ofEngland, thus denying primary dealers some of their bestcustomers. Commission would have been passed along to customerswho did place orders via the primary dealers, making it lessexpensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.    Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions withthe dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that theallotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had aconcurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless ofmarket conditions.    Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to bedisappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along withthe plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that anyconditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandonedor modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficientor unwieldy.    Among other items in the document, the Bank said its firstauction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventionalshort-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.    Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financialyear would first be of up to one billion stg of long-datedstock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up toone billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years inmaturity.    The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would bemet by traditional tap offerings of stock via the governmentbroker.    To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, theBank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stockof the same type, and it will not necessarily resume sellingthe stock once the fallow period expires.    In the event that prices offered for the stock to be soldare substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bankwill agree to take the stock onto its own books.    The bank would then be free to sell the stock during thefallow period but not at a price below the minimum tenderprice.    The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions willbe alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which biddersare allotted stock at the price which they bid.    However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit anymoney market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a singleauction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned aboutpreventing a single market maker from cornering a stock todrive the price up.   The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to preventdealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuingadditional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.    The Bank has also agreed to publish information about theauction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete,which is widely expected to be on the same day.    Information to be released will include the amount of stockallotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids,and the highest, lowest and average price of the successfulbids.";unknown

" LENDING PATTERN CHANGING - MANILA BANK CHIEF     MANILA, April 17 - International banks have radicallychanged their attitudes towards debt and lending and debtornations will have to explore new methods of ensuring inflows,Philippine Central Bank Governor Jose Fernandez said.    ""Commercial banks have tended to be rather difficult interms of new money for some time now,"" he told reporters at anews conference. ""Within the world there are enormous changestaking place in attitudes of different banks.""    He said the banks were no longer flush with funds from thepost-1973 oil boom and were reluctant to lend money.    ""They don't have the same kind of money they used to have... They find their whole deposit base eroding,"" Fernandez said.Groups of major banks had decided that the international arenawas not to their liking.    ""They wind up with 7/8 (over Eurodollar rates) and who wants7/8 really? It's nothing. They want to get the frills, but ifthey are not big enough they don't get the frills.""    The Philippines on Wednesday announced it wanted torenegotiate a debt restructuring accord it reached on March 27with its 12-bank advisory committee, saying it wanted the sameterms as were granted to Argentina earlier this week.    Argentina was granted a 19-year repayment at 13/16 pointsover Eurodollar rates, the same historically low spread thatMexico won last October, while the Philippines, which hadinsisted on a deal similar to Mexico's, restructured 10.3billion dlrs of its 28.2 billion dlr foreign debt at 7/8.    Fernandez said the old type of new-money agreement, wherehundreds of banks were forced into involuntary lending by anadvisory committee that negotiated agreements with debtorcountries, was becoming increasingly difficult.    He said involuntary lending proved useful in the two orthree years since the Mexican debt crisis in 1982.    ""But the present tendency has been that more and more of thebanks, specially the regionals or the small ones, have eithersold off their portfolios or simply by policy will not put upany more money,"" Fernandez said.    He said another disturbing development was the so-callednational quota approach adopted by groups of banks.    ""Groups of banks by nationality have chosen to take a lookat what other groups of banks in other countries are willing todo and if let us say British banks wind up giving 99 pct ofwhat is needed and U.S. Banks give only 92 pct, then theBritish banks say as a whole they will pull out,"" he said.    ""There are banks that have decided that lending is not agood business any more. They want to deal in securities, theywant to go into investment banking, they want to go into theturnover business rather than the carry business,"" Fernandezsaid. ""We have to thread our way through a constellation ofbanks, all of whom have different objectives.""    He said in order to survive, the Philippines would have totry and stimulate new types of inflows, ""whether this be directinvestments, whether this be investments by institutions thatnow have chosen not to lend but to invest, or whether this bedebt to equity conversions.""";unknown
" PROBLEMS FOR WORLD BANK IN DEBT STRATEGY<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, June 2 - The World Bank, in the throes of apainful reorganization, faces new strains because of actions byCitibank and others to set aside new Latin debt reserves,financial analysts and monetary sources said.    The monetary sources said the reorganization has causedsome bad feelings and charges that promotions and otherpersonnel actions have been based on personality rather thanability. It also had some effect in undermining the Bank's rolein the global debt strategy, the sources said.    At the center of the controversy is Bank President BarberConable, whose reorganization efforts are getting some critical review from many Bank staff members and some member-countries including the United States.    ""I think if he were to do it again, he would do it verydifferently,"" said one source.    Conable, a former congressman from New York appointed byPresident Reagan to the senior most position at the Bank nearlya year ago, has taken the view that the Bank badly needed to bereorganized and perhaps made more streamlined.    In this he had the backing of many in the Reaganadministration who viewed the Bank as a bloated and inefficientbureaucracy that gave money to countries when other free-marketsources of assistance were available.    However, the Bank had been singled out for a much greaterrole under the U.S. debt initiative proposed by TreasurySecretary James Baker.  That strategy, which called for some 20billion dlrs in new funding from the commerical banks and ninebillion dlrs in spending from the development banks, mostly theWorld Bank, came under profound doubt with the decision byCitibank and Chase Manhattan to set aside new reserves.    This move, heralded by some sources as a measure that givesall parties more time, frightened others, who see it as thebeginning of a tit for tat exercise that could lead to completeunraveling of the monetary system.    As envisioned by the latter, the next move would be forBrazil, which has delayed payments on its debts, to say it doesnot intend to pay interest for a very long period of time.    Citibank and other banks could then decide to stopfinancing the country's export credits, the funds countries useto support their daily activities, leading to an economicbreakdown.    ""Within six weeks alot of countries could be out ofbusiness,"" said one source.    Citibank's initial step last month was to set some threebillion dlrs in a general reserve for potential losses on loansto developing countries.  It was followed by a similar move byChase Manhattan some days later.    In the best of all worlds, the kind of cooperation that wasdemonstrated between the International Monetary Fund (IMF), themultilateral development banks, the wealthy countries andcommercial banks when the debt crisis surfaced in 1982, couldemerge again but no one is expecting that.    If anything, the negotiations have become much moreconfrontational with the debtor countries pressing for moreconcessions, arguing that they face growing politicalinstability if they are asked to do or pay more.    They are very critical of the IMF's austerity measures andthere is sympathy for their view among the developmentcommunity.    ""When you hear code words like structural adjustment andtightening your belt.  What that means is that the poor peasentmaking 700 dlrs a year should drop it to 500 dlrs,"" says onesource.    He adds: ""And when your hear they should have market forcesat play, that means the level of public services should drop.""    It had been hoped that giving the World Bank a greater rolein the debt strategy might defuse the growing resistance in thedebtor countries to measures that increased already prevalentpoverty even further.   The Bank, which primarily assists countries in the buildingof roads, sewerage systems, education, and other so-calledinfrastructure, is viewed in the Third World as benefactor.   The IMF, however, which essentially forged the debt stategyfollowing the disclosure by Mexico in 1982 that it was neardefault, is considered a stern taskmaster that has littlesympathy or even understanding of poverty.    But there are doubts about how well the Baker initiativehas worked and about the World Bank's success at bringing aboutincreased growth in the Third World under the U.S. prescriptionwhich indicated that countries might grow their way out oftheir difficulty.";unknown

" REASSURES CREDITORS ON ECONOMIC REFORMS    STOCKHOLM, April 8 - Plans to rejuvenate Poland's economyby reducing central government control would help reassureWestern creditors that the country's economy was safe to investin, a senior Polish official said.    ""The business of granting loans to Poland is not as bad abusiness as you might imagine,"" senior Polish governmentspokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference in Stockholm.

" JUNK BONDS UNAFFECTED BY TEXACO <TX> FILING<AUTHOR>    By John Picinich, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 13 - Despite a sharp early fall in TexacoInc bonds, the 125 billion dlr U.S. junk bond market waslargely unaffected by Texaco's weekend filing for protectionunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, analysts said.    ""Texaco's filing had little, if any, effect on junk bondprices this morning. It should not spill over to the overallmarket like LTV Corp's <LTV> bankruptcy filing did lastsummer,"" said one analyst.    Traders said some Texaco debt issues fell over 30 pointsthis morning in thin trading, but recouped about half that.    ""Because of the Texaco filing, some investors bid down itspaper to the mid-60 area (around 650 dlrs per 1,000 dlr facevalue) from around 95 Friday,"" said a dealer in high-yield, lowrated bonds.    ""But sellers could not be found at those levels and thebids soon rebounded to the 75 to 85 area,"" he added, referringto such issues as Texaco's 13 pct notes of 1991, the 13-1/4s of1999 and 13-5/8s of 1994. All were in the mid-90s Friday.    The rebound occurred after Standard and Poor's Corpdowngraded the debt ratings of 8.4 billion dlrs of debt ofTexaco and its subsidiaries to D, traders noted.    S and P cited the weekend bankruptcy filing. The agencysaid it uses the D grade for securities issued by companies inChapter 11 reorganization.    Moody's Investors Service Inc followed suit, cutting mostof the debt of Texaco and its units to Caa.    The junk bond market experienced a short-lived downturnlast summer when LTV's bankruptcy filing sparked worries thatcredit conditions of other steel companies would also worsen.    ""This is clearly not the case with Texaco,"" said onetrader. Because of their high yields, junk bonds have latelyoutperformed investment grade corporates, he and others said.    Analysts and portfolio managers said they viewed Texaco'sbankruptcy filing as a defensive move.    Indeed, a Texas State Court of Appeal this morning said thebankruptcy petition effectively stays Texaco's obligation underTexas law to post a bond in its 10.53 billion dlr litigationagainst Pennzoil Co <PZL>.    ""The filing was not the result of credit weakness. Thecompany got through the oil crisis alright,"" said one portfoliomanager.

Asked if creditor banks would accept Brazil's refinancingneeds based on a new economic program not endorsed by theInternational Monetary Fund, Funaro said, ""What other options dothey have?...They have to try to see our program.""    Funaro, who is in Washington to attend the InterimCommittee and Development Committee meetings of the World Bankand IMF, said he unveiled his refinancing proposals to themajor creditor banks in New York yesterday.    According to Funaro, the creditor banks ""agreed on the needto find a solution to the crisis."" He did not elaborate.    Funaro said the commercial banks agreed on Brazil's needfor economic growth and added that creditors were aware thatBrazil cannot continue to export the 24 billion dlrs in netcapital that it transferred over the past three years.    He also said that he told bankers about Brazil's needs toensure a seven pct average growth and eight billion to 11billion dlr trade surplus until 1991.    Administration officials familiar with the negotiationssaid Brazil's new economic measures did not make much sensebased on current conditions in that country, and added thatthey saw long and difficult negotiations ahead.    Lewis Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan and Co. Inc., toldReuters he remains hopeful that Brazil and its foreign bankcreditors will reach a debt rescheduling agreement before theend of the year.    But Preston, who did not attend the meeting between Funaroand creditor banks yesterday, added the onus is still on Brazilto put its economic house in order first.    ""They haven't even come up with a plan yet,"" Preston saidafter Morgan's annual meeting in New York today.    Funaro, however, said most creditor banks hadrepresentatives in Brazil who were well aware of Brazil's neweconomic measures, designed to curb a surge in inflation andspending and a sharp drop in exports.    Funaro called Brazil's program very responsible and verystrong, adding that ""it is very different from other years,there has been a tremendous change.""    Based on Brazil's current economic situation - suspensionof interest payments on 67 billion dlrs owed to banks, 200 pctinflation and the need of four billion dlrs in new loans everyyear until 1991 - he said he was faced with two options.REUTER...";unknown
" STATE COMPANY BONDS PROVOKE COMPLAINTS<AUTHOR>    By Ajoy Sen, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW DELHI, April 9 - India's private businessmen say theyhave been placed on an unequal footing in raising money fromthe capital market because government companies are wooinginvestors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds.    Stock brokers and bankers polled by Reuters said althoughequity shares or debenture issues floated by private firmsprovide a higher return and shorter maturity, they are fastlosing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealthand income taxes.    Brokers said many investors are transferring funds intogovernment company bonds because of their tax-free status andeasy transferability.    About 100 private companies have postponed plans to issueequity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal1987/88 partly on account of fierce competition from publicsector bonds, a merchant banker said.    They included equity shares and rights issue worth onebillion rupees planned to be issued this month by TataFertilisers Ltd, he said, adding the issue has been postponedindefinitely.    ""The government bonds are making serious inroads on theprivate sector companies' resources,"" said R. P. Goenka,president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce andIndustry.    ""The discriminatory tax treatment should be done away withand equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobiliseresources from the market which is common to both,"" Goenka said.    A senior Finance Ministry official said government andprivate firms were free to compete to raise resources, addingit was not correct that public sector-issued bonds werepreventing private firms from raising money on the stockmarket.    ""Debentures and equity shares floated by private companiesstill account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised instock exchanges,"" the ministry official said.    A spokesman at Bombay stock brokers Batliwala and Karanisaid government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees orabout 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government andnon-government firms in the domestic capital market in 1986/87.    The share was 35 to 40 pct of about 36.95 billion rupeesmobilised in 1985/86, he said. ""To save taxes, commercial banks,mainly foreign banks, and some private companies, are investingtheir surplus funds in the tax free bonds,"" he said.    ""Individuals who are very well off are also investing in thebonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are goingfor equities or debentures floated by private companies on aselective basis,"" the spokesman said.    The maturity period of government company bonds variesbetween seven and 10 years. No wealth or income taxes arepayable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pctinterest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amount^Mexceeds 7,000 rupees a year.    Equity shares, the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and12.5 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by privatecompanies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or fromthe tax on income earned from them.    The government bonds are listed as securities but traded onIndia's four major stock exchanges. They can be sold freely onthe stock market by simple endorsement while debentures canonly be sold to the company after one year, brokers said.    Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom inthe stock market since 1984/85 sparked by liberal taxconcessions and reforms in exchange operations, brokers said.    The National Thermal Power Corp, NTPC, was the firstgovernment company to issue the bonds to raise one billionrupees in January last year, breaking the monopoly of privatecompanies on the capital market. The seven-year NTPC bond wasoversubscribed three times, brokers said.    Official figures show bonds floated by government companieshave been heavily oversubscribed. More state companies havesought the Ministry's permission to issue them in comingmonths.    NTPC's second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 4.51billion rupees against 1.2 billion originally permitted by theFinance Ministry.    The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 3.83 billion rupeeslast year against authorised 1.5 billion and last month theIndian Railway Finance Corporation's record susbcriptiontotalled 5.5 billion rupees against authorised 2.5 billion.    In most cases, the government has allowed the companies tomaintain the oversubscribed amount, brokers said.    Goenka said that government bonds are making itincreasingly difficult for private companies to launch newequity or debenture issues. He said the government could atleast ""fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised throughsuch bonds by the public sector.""    Merchant bankers said the government is pressing statecompanies to borrow from the public by reducing financialsupport to them.    To ease its internal debt burden, the government hasreduced the budgetary support to development investment inabout 120 public sector companies to 69.92 billion rupees in1987/88 from 77.92 billion a year earlier, official figuresshow.";unknown

" BANK (RY.TO) RECLASSIFIES BRAZIL LOANS    MONTREAL, June 2 - Royal Bank of Canada said it classified1.3 billion dlrs in medium and long-term loans to Brazil asnon-accrual, leading to a seven pct drop in second quarterprofit.    ""The designation of these loans as non-accrual reduced thebank's earnings by about 22 mln dlrs after tax,"" chairman AllanTaylor said in a statement. ""Without this reduction,second-quarter earnings would have been about 138 mln dlrs,"" a10 pct increase over last year's profit, Taylor said.    The bank earlier reported second quarter profit fell to116.2 mln dlrs from 125.1 mln dlrs a year ago.    The bank said domestic earnings rose to a record 125 mlndlrs in the second quarter, a 52 mln dlr increase from the yearbefore, due to higher business volumes and securities gains aswell as a better yield from its domestic non-accrual loanportfolio.    It said international operations reported a net after-taxloss of nine mln dlrs, compared with a 52 mln dlr profit lastyear. The decline largely reflects the impact of Brazil'ssuspended interest payments, which resulted in about a 40 mlndlr reduction in net interest income, Royal Bank said.    Royal Bank said it keeping its 1987 loan loss experienceestimate unchanged from the last quarter at one billion dlrs.It said it is committed to building its general provision forloan losses to at least 20 pct of total outstanding loans totroubled sovereign borrowers by the end of 1989.

" SEES QUICK COMPLETION OF DEBT DEAL<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 17 - Argentina's controversial newfinancing package should be completed quickly thanks to a widerange of innovative options in the deal, said Jorge Gonzalez,undersecretary for external debt in the economics ministry.    The deal offers banks a lucrative fee if they sign earlyand an ""exit bond"" provision allowing banks to sell as much asfive mln dlrs of their existing loans. Gonzalez also disclosedthat banks will have the choice of lending up to one mln dlrsin the form of a bearer bond. ""We expect to complete thepackage very quickly,"" he said in a telephone interview.    By providing their share of the 1.55 billion dlrs in newmoney being raised for Argentina via an easily tradable bearerbond instead of a participation in the syndicated loan, smallerbanks could avoid time-consuming legal paperwork.    The bonds, currently dubbed ""alternative participationinstruments,"" would carry the same terms as the syndicated loan- a 12-year term, five years' grace and an interest rate marginof 7/8 pct over Eurodollar rates, Gonzalez said.    The idea of the ""exit bond"" is that a creditor bank mayexchange up to five mln dlrs of existing debt for a new,tradeable bond that bears below-market interest rates.    In return for accepting a lower yield, the amount of debtconverted will be subtracted from the bank's exposure forpurposes of calculating its contribution to future new loans.    Gonzalez said it was difficult to say how many banks wouldtake up the ""exit bonds"" because no such instrument has beenoffered before.    On paper, however, Argentina's lending syndicate couldshrink dramatically because over 100 of the country's 350creditors have exposure of less than five mln dlrs.    Details of the ""exit bonds"" are still being finalized,Gonzalez added.    Argentina has pressed hard for a streamlining of thelending process because it has bitter memories of its lastpackage, which was agreed with the Citibank-led steeringcommittee in December 1984 but not signed until August 1985.    Gonzalez praised the committee for its cooperation in thelatest negotiations and said the resulting deal, which wasannounced by the banks on Wednesday, should put Argentina onthe road to meeting its economic goals.    ""We believe this is a package that will help Argentine tocontinue on the track it has elected to follow - stable growthand equilibrium in the external accounts,"" he said.    Asked what role the Reagan Administration had played in thefinal stages of the talks, Gonzalez said it had lent ""practicalsupport.""    He did not elaborate, but bankers said the U.S. had pressedfor an agreement after Economics Minister Juan Sourrouillethreatened at last week's spring meeting in Washington of theInternational Monetary Fund to break off talks unless banksstopped blocking a deal.    The specter of Argentina emulating Brazil and suspendinginterest payments haunted policymakers and bankers alike, whohave long feared the emergence of a debtors' cartel.    ""That was a feeling among people on the committee,"" onebanker said.    As a result bankers agreed to give Argentina the sameinterest rate margin as Mexico, 13/16 pct, on the reschedulingof 30 billion dlrs of debt, even though they knew this wouldraise the ire of the Philippines and Venezuela, which paid 7/8pct on recent rescheduling packages.    Asked about the angry reaction of the Manila government,which promptly said Wednesday that it would demand a spread of13/16 pct, Gonzalez said this was a matter between thePhilippines and the banks.";unknown

" BOOSTS BUDGET CASH FOR DEBT SERVICING    KHARTOUM, June 19 - Sudan has set aside 781.6 mln dlrs toservice foreign debts in 1987/88, according to budget planspresented to parliament.    This compares with 200 mln dlrs earmarked for debtrepayment in the year ending June 30. Sudan has a foreign debttotalling 10.6 billion dlrs.    Finance Minister Beshir Omar, presenting plans toparliament last night, put the budget deficit at 2.88 billionpounds, against 2.85 billion in 1986/87.

Omar said government revenue in 1987/88 would total 3.9billion pounds. Expenditure was put at 6.79 billion pounds.    He said the budget deficit would be fully covered by loans,government deposits and other sources.    Omar said 375 mln pounds would be spent on subsidisingsugar and wheat flour prices in 1987/88.

" BANK CAN AID PHILIPPINES' LAND DEVELOPMENT<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>    MANILA, June 2 - The World Bank's policies prevent it fromlending money for the transfer of land from landowners to thelandless, but it can help finance development of thePhilippines' proposed land reform program, a bank officialsaid.    ""The World Bank by its established policies cannot use itsresources to finance the transfer of assets from one group toanother. Our mandate is to finance investment-relatedactivities,"" Rolando Arrivillaga, the bank's residentrepresentative in the Philippines, told Reuters in aninterview.    Arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by aWorld Bank mission that came in March to review the land reformprogram and which said the bank would not be able to financecompensation payments for the transfer of land.    He said the Philippine government had never asked the bankto finance land transfers, and the bank's position should notbe taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program.    ""Clearly in the case of land reform the question of landtransfer by definition is transferring assets from the landedto the landless,"" Arrivillaga said. ""However, the bank as aninstitution can finance the development aspects of the program.""    ""We will deal with the part of the program that deals withhow to put the land to effective use once it has beentransferred and how to make the on-farm investments that areneeded to attain the goal of improving the income level of thebeneficiaries,"" Arrivillaga said.    ""I wouldn't be surprised if other multilateral institutionsare faced with similar constraints,"" he said.    President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said last week thatshe was committed to launching the program, which limits landholdings to seven hectares, by using her sweeping powers ofrule by decree before a new Congress convenes in July.    Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said the land reformprogram, estimated to cost about 44 billion pesos, would beimplemented in four phases and benefit 2.64 mln farmers.    Benigno said the first two phases would complete thetransfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as wellas the transfer of land sequestered, expropriated or foreclosedby the government and would cover 1.15 mln hectares.    But Aquino would not decree the redistribution of largesugar, banana and coconut plantations, leaving it to theCongress to work out the details, Benigno said.    Arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors, who form part of aconsultative group led by the World Bank, might be prepared tofinance the land transfers.    ""I don't think there are fast and easy rules as to howinternational sources of finance would behave in a situationlike this, because land reform by its very nature requires richfinancing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitableto both the landowner and the beneficiary,"" he said.    Arrivillaga said the first priority for the governmentwould be to tap domestic sources of financing for the landtransfer, but external assistance could be brought in if therewere gaps.    ""In such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness ofthe government is how it confronts the domestic resourcerequirement,"" Arrivillaga said. ""Multilateral agencies by theirvery nature are lenders of last resort. It means they have tobe convinced that the government prioritises the program.""    He said the World Bank had financed developmental costsunder an earlier land reform program launched by formerPresident Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, and such aid had beenchannelled through the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP).    The LBP is the main implementing agency under Aquino'sprogram.    ""If asked to do so again and the program is designed toimprove the standard of living of the poor then we wouldcertainly be prepared to consider (lending),"" Arrivillaga said.    He said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate thecosts by presenting ten-year perspectives in a one-yearcontext.    Arrivillaga said the government could solve most of itsfinancing problems by devising effective instruments tocompensate landowners.    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said landowners arelikely to be paid 10 pct in cash and the rest in 10-year bondswith 10 pct of their face value redeemable each year.    Arrivillaga said any instruments used to compensatelandowners had to be freely tradable at near face value andadded: ""The challenge is to devise a system of deferred paymentsthat is as good as cash.""    He said the international financing community was watchingthe Philippine experiment with great interest.    ""They are going to be an interesting model for many othercountries because they opened a dialogue on the reforms toevery sector of the population and even internationalinstitutions,"" he said. ""I think they'll be on a very solid basewhen they make the decision to launch the reforms.""";unknown

" DEBTORS MAKE NEW PUSH FOR DEBT RELIEF<AUTHOR>    By Keith Grant, Reuters</AUTHOR>    GUANAJUATO, Mexico, June 1 - Rising interest rates andprotectionist trade policies had prompted a new push by LatinAmerican nations to win debt relief, regional foreign andfinance ministry officials said here.    Officials of the Cartagena group of 11 debtor nations methere this week to draw up new proposals in reaction to whatthey called a deteriorating world panorama, and Citicorp'sdecision to create reserves against third world loans.    (SEE ECRA FOR SPOTLIGHT HEADLINES)    ""We are looking at trade, interest rates and financialflows.....In order to put forward a basis for some permanentsolutions,"" Mexico's public credit director Angel Gurria said.    Recent developments have led to moves for a summit of LatinAmerican presidents and debate on new solutions.    Ideas include schemes to link debt payments to trade, andproposals for stable interest rates. The latter was proposed ina letter this week from Cartagena to G-7 leaders who are due toattend a summit in Venice this month.    Another idea is to include debt under Gatt negotiations,but Cartegena ministers have yet to endorse any proposals.    Speaking earlier in New York, Uruguay's Foreign Ministerand Cartagena group chairman Enrique Iglesias said Citicorp'sdecision could discourage new lending. But it might helpCartagena's bid to have old and new debt treated separately.    The Cartagena group, which has not met at ministerial levelfor over a year, wants to repay debt contracted before the debtcrisis at the low interest rates prevailing in the 1970s. Itwould pay new loans at current market rates.    ""Many countries fear that what they have gained in months ofarduous debt negotiations they can lose at a stroke with a onepoint rise in interest rates,"" one official here said.    ""The new increase in interest rates has come precisely whenwe thought they had still not come down enough,"" Iglesias said.    Latin American officials are also concerned that varyinginterest spreads granted to different debtor nations couldgenerate discord, as with the Philippines' recent protest atbeing given less favourable terms than Argentina.    There has been speculation Venezuela would demand a cut inits 7/8 pct spread, but public finances director Jorge Marcanosaid here there were no plans to renegotiate terms.    This week's meeting came after three Latin Americanpresidents meeting in Montevideo called for stable interestrates on the region's 380 billion dlr foreign debt. It wascalled to review developments since the last ministerialmeeting in February 1986 and to think up new ideas.    Since the last ministerial meeting there have been someadvances, such as Mexico's growth-oriented 77 billion dlr loanand refinancing package agreed last September. But there havealso been setbacks, like Brazil's payments moratorium.    The loans expected in the Baker plan have not materializedand debtors have been forced to browbeat reluctant banks.    ""We have clearly stretched the restructuring process to itslimits and and the question is now where do we go from here?"" asenior Mexican foreign ministry official said.    Existing debt strategy has been based on nursing debtoreconomies back to a position where they can again service theirdebts and qualify for new loans.    But after five years of economic adjustment, Latin Americandebtors are currently unable to raise voluntary credits, withthe exception of Colombia. Only Venezuela is paying backprincipal. Most countries have no prospect of paying theirdebts in the foreseeable future.    Citicorp has made clear its decision to move three billiondlrs to reserves does not mean it is writing-off the loans.    Latin American officials here said Citicorp's move wouldprobably boost trading of discounted third world debt in thesecondary market, implicitly downvaluing the amount owed. Butthey said it might make new lending even more remote.    Discounted debt can be bought by foreign investors throughdebt-equity schemes that generate new resources for debtoreconomies. Chile and Mexico are currently front-runners in thisfield, but most Latin American officials see these schemes aslimited and no panacea for the overall problem.    Most Latin officials set greater store on building upexport income than on debt-equity schemes.    Exports hit 97.7 billion dlrs in 1984, cutting the region'sdebt service ratio to 36 pct, but they fell to 78.3 billionlast year. So, even though interest rates had dropped the ratiohardly changed.    The Cartagena group has called for the debt-trade link tobe recognized before, but has not made detailed proposals.    Officials said initiatives discussed here would besubmitted to foreign and finance ministers of the 11 nations,before IMF and World Bank annual meetings later this year.";unknown

Citibank, the chairman of Argentina's bank advisorycommittee, said yesterday that subscriptions totalled about 91pct.    The IMF has said that a ""critical mass"" of bank commitmentsis needed before it will start disbursing the 1.83 billion dlrstandby loan that it has approved in principle for Argentina.    Asked what the IMF has stipulated as a critical mass,Sourrouille said, ""That has not been defined but anywhere over90 pct we are doing fine.""

" LEAVES VOID ON LDC DEBT, BANKERS SAY<AUTHOR>    BY ALAN WHEATLEY, REUTERS</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 2 - Paul Volcker's resignation as FederalReserve Board chairman creates a serious leadership vacuum at atime of deep uncertainty about the future management of thethird-world debt crisis, bankers said.    They said Volcker did more than any other official to holdthe financial system together when Mexico halted interestpayments in August 1982 and has played a central role eversince.    ""Where is the leadership going to come from? Suddenlythere's a terrible void,"" one New York banker said.    Volcker's expertise will be all the more sorely missedbecause International Monetary Fund managing director MichelCamdessus is new to his job and Barber Conable is finding ithard to make a mark as World Bank president, bankers said.    Moreover, Volcker's successor, Alan Greenspan, has littleexperience of international affairs and third world debt.    ""Greenspan does not have the sensitivity to these issuesand the sense of understanding of their complexity that Volckerhas. Volcker understands what motivates people outside the U.S.That was in his gut. Greenspan just does not have the intuitivefeeling,"" one banker said.    This banker, who has discussed debt questions withGreenspan, described his views as simplistic.    But Robert Hormats of Goldman, Sachs and Co said he was notworried by Greenspan's lack of international experience.    ""People rush to judgment, but once they get to knowGreenspan I'm sure they'll find him an excellent replacement,""said Hormats, a former Administration official.    Anyone nominated to replace Volcker would have paled in theinitial comparison, Hormats said. ""Volcker had the status of afinancial demigod and you can't attain that status overnight,""he said.    One veteran debt rescheduler said Volcker, together withthe Bank of England, deserves credit for keeping the bankingsystem intact after Mexico's default.    ""If it hadn't been for him, the world would look a lotdifferent now,"" he said. ""Whether you agreed with him or not,he has a superb grasp of ideas.""    Certainly, not all bankers did agree all the time withVolcker. In particular, he was roundly criticized by some formore or less forcing them last September to grant Mexicogenerous terms on its 77 billion dlr new-loan and debtrescheduling agreement.    ""Volcker lost a lot of credibility by overstepping thebounds and pushing the package onto the banks,"" commented onebanker who helped to negotiate the Mexican deal.    Another critic was Citicorp chairman John Reed, who saidthe 13/16 pct interest margin would deter some bank lenders andthus delay Mexico's return to the voluntary markets.    It was a review of the fate of the Mexican deal - and ofothers that followed it for Chile, Venezuela, the Philippinesand Argentina - that helped to convince Reed that the debtcrisis was not about to be solved and that Citicorp needed tobolster its reserves in case some of the loans went bad.    ""It certainly contributed to the general feeling ofmalaise,"" one Citicorp banker said in describing the impact ofthe Mexican package on the bank's decision to add three billiondlrs to its reserve for possible loan losses.    That decision, since followed by Chase Manhattan andSecurity Pacific Corp, may profoundly alter the strategy ofcreditors and debtors alike for tackling the debt crisis.

" TO NEW ARGENTINE LOAN REACH 91 PCT    NEW YORK, June 18 - Commitments to Argentina's externalfinancing program for 1987 and 1988 have reached about 91 pctof the 1.95 billion dlrs in new loans that banks have beenasked to provide, Citibank and Argentina said in a jointstatement.

Some bankers had feared that banks would refuse to lend newmoney so soon after taking a ""hit"" on the old loans, buttoday's news delivers a decisive rebuff to those skeptics.

" DEBT PAYMENTS TO BE ADJUSTED TO EXPORTS    BELGRADE, Oct 19 - Yugoslav Prime Minister Branko Mikulic,unveiling a new draft economic program, said Yugoslavia wouldcut repayments on its almost 20 billion lr hard currency debtto bring them in line with its hard currency earning capacity.    ""We have decided to coordinate repayment of our debt withrealistically assessed capabilities of our economy,"" he said inParliament. He said the current debt-service ratio (over 40 pctof export revenue) was too high.    Yugoslavia is to negotiate a long-term restructuring of itsdebt after missing repayments in recent months, Mikulic said.    ""If we did not change the dynamics of repaying our debt, thesituation would become increasingly worse,"" Mikulic said.    He said on the present repayment schedule, Yugoslavia wouldhave a net outflow of two billion dlrs and the level of debtwould be halved by 1995. But he added:    ""The consequences would not only mean slower economic growthin the coming years but also further exhaustion of the economyand lasting damage to the economy's capacity for development,""he said.    ""All that would, of course, intensify social difficulties,""Mikulic added.    The state news agency Tanjug said on October 9 thatYugoslavia plans to adjust debt repayments over the next eightyears and to cut the debt-service ratio to 25 pct.    Yugoslavia failed to make a principal repayment due lastmonth which had already been postponed by 90 days.    Mikulic's proposed economic program, which also includeshigher personal taxes as well as wage and price restraint, isintended to serve as a basis for the debt talks to demonstrateYugoslavia's ability to eventually repay the credits.    His program has to be discussed and approved by parliamentby early November.    Mikulic said foreign debt should be retained at about thesame level as now until 1990 and the country should then beable to keep currency reserves equal to three months payments.    ""Of course, these are our proposals for talks withcreditors. We expect understanding and support because it is intheir interest as well,"" Mikulic said.    He said that under the present schedule debt payments hadslowed economic development and exhausted currency reserves.Banking sources say Yugoslavia's reserves are inadequate atpresent for even one month's debt and import bill.";unknown

" TERM NOTES POISED FOR GROWTH<AUTHOR>    By Marguerite Nugent, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, April 13 - Euro-medium term notes, a recentphenomenon in the international capital markets, are hardlyattracting a flood of issuers but investment bankers are doingtheir best to breath life into the market.    Medium term notes (MTNs) have met with staggering successin the U.S. Market where total outstandings have grown toaround 50 billion dlrs since 1983, the year they took hold as anew financing vehicle to bridge the gap between commercialpaper and longer term bonds. Convinced they are here to stay,investment bankers are attempting to adapt MTNs for theeuromarket.    Ralph Bunche, a vice president of Morgan StanleyInternational, predicted at a recent Euromoney conference onMTNs here that they will become the predominant instrument forraising funds in the late 1980's and 1990's. ""It (the MTNmarket) will even surpass the bond market,"" he said.    Other bankers took exception with the degree to which MTNswill grow. But they generally agreed that these instrumentsprovide the borrower with greater flexibility and lower coststhan a traditional bond.    The trick is in convincing European borrowers it is wortharranging a program and, having accomplished that, to persaudeEuropean investors -- whose preferences differ from their U.S.Counterparts -- to buy the securities.    Discussions with bankers proved one thing. No one isexactly sure how to proceed with structuring and marketingthese issues.    To date only 13 Euro-MTN programs have been announced butonly a few have been activated, such as those for a unit ofPepsiCo Inc and another for AB Electrolux.    Several firms have devised different structures forEuro-MTNs and defend their structures adamantly.    The PepsiCo notes, for example, are sold on a continuouslyoffered basis. This involves a small amount of new notes withsimilar maturities constantly on offer at current market rates.    The Electrolux program uses multi-tranche tap notes devisedby Merrill Lynch. Under this structure, an initial tranche of aminimum 50 mln dlrs has a fixed rate of interest and maturity.The borrower then issues additional notes in this category upto a pre-determined maximum.    Those who defend the continuously offered method, such asWendy Dietze, a Salomon Brothers Inc vice president, point tothe flexibility they offer in interest rate and maturity.    Furthermore, she believes this structure offers theEuropean investor greater confidence in market liquidity -- amajor concern for these buyers.    Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd's Kevin Regan defends themedium-tranche tap notes concept saying it offers comparableliquidity. But he also said that this structure may not be theright option for all borrowers.    Peter Mortimer, a partner in the law firm Milbank, Tweed,Hadley and McCloy, noted that legal requirements could welldetermine which structure is chosen.    He noted that the tap system allows a more clearly defined""lock-up"" period as each tranche has a specific maturity. In thecase of notes issued by U.S. Borrowers, the ""lock-up"" period isthe 90 days after the completion of a series during which timea security cannot be sold back to the U.S. Or to U.S.Investors.    However, he said that the Securities and ExchangeCommission is reviewing its current regulations on theownership of foreign securities by U.S. Citizens and that somesoftening in the rules could come in the not too distantfuture.    For their part borrowers say they feel a bit like guineapigs.    Petter Skouen, executive vice president of the NordicInvestment Bank (NIB), noted that a few weeks ago NIB wouldhave said it was disappointed with its Euro-MTN program, butthat the success of a recent issue changed their minds.    He conceded that in retrospect it would have been wiser toestablish separate programs for the euromarket and the U.S.Domestic market, rather than try to extend the U.S. Issueglobally. Under NIB's 200 mln dlr program, 100 mln has beensold in the U.S. And 25 mln in Europe.";unknown

" HAS NO PLANS TO SEEK REVISED DEBT ACCORD    GUANAJUATO, Mexico, June 1 - Venezuela has no plans to tryto renegotiate the debt rescheduling agreement it worked outwith creditor banks in February, public finance director JorgeMarcano told Reuters.    Speaking here after a meeting of the 11-nation Cartagenagroup, Marcano said he was aware of political pressure at hometo reduce debt payments but did not think such a move wouldbenefit Venezuela.    ""We have no intention of revising the terms of the accord,""he said. ""There would be little to gain and in fact it wouldprobably be detrimental.""    Venezuela agreed with its bank advisory committee on a 14.5year rescheduling of 20.3 billion dlrs in public sector foreigndebt, with an interest rate 7/8 pct over Libor. The previousagreement, reached a year before but never implemented, was for12-1/2 years with a 1-1/8 pct spread.    In Caracas there have recently been calls to invoke theagreement's contingency clause which the government used lastyear to amend the original terms after a 40 pct drop in oilincome.    But Marcano said the bulk of payments to be made this yearare on private debts and non-rescheduled public debts.    Marcano said Venezuela, which has reduced its debt by sixbillion dlrs since 1983, should have no problems in repayingrestructured debt this year or next.    Asked whether the government felt badly treated with its7/8 pct spread when Mexico and Argentina have won a 13/16 pctmargin, Marcano said he still felt Venezuela had a good deal.    ""Venezuela has restructured its debt so that most of it isbeing repaid at 7/8 pct, which I think is better than the othercountries,"" he said. The rescheduling accord covers some 90 pctof Venezuela's commercial bank debt, which accounts for morethan 90 pct of the total public sector external debt.    Venezuela has almost no debt outstanding to multilateralagencies.    Marcano said attempting to revise the rescheduling accord asecond time would probably hurt Venezuela's bid to restore itcredit rating and raise new loans.    He said Venezuela now obtains trade credit lines without agovernment guarantee, something that Argentina and others arejust starting to try to negotiate in their restructuringpackages.    Venezuela is currently seeking loans in Japan and WestGermany to finance steel and aluminium expansion.    According to finance minister Manuel Azpurua, a 100 mlnmark credit has been lined up for the Venalum aluminium plant.    Marcano said no mandate has yet been given for a planned100 mln dlr bond issue, although he confirmed that talks werecontinuing with Morgan Guaranty and other banks.    Banking sources said one option was to privately place thebonds through the Caracas-based Banco de Venezuela, which wouldunderwrite the issue, but Marcano said no decision has yet beenmade.";unknown

 MANAGING DIRECTOR HOLDS TALKS IN IVORY COAST    ABIDJAN, June 29 - IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessuspaid a brief weekend visit to the Ivory Coast during which hediscussed the country's economic difficulties with PresidentFelix Houphouet-Boigny.    Camdessus said he wished his visit could have been in morepleasant circumstances in remarks reported by the officialIvorian daily Fraternite Matin.    He added that the extremely steep fall in agriculturalcommodity markets had dealt a harsh blow this year to theIvorian economy and because of this the country wasexperiencing a growth problem and difficulties with itsinternational debt.    Last month the Ivory Coast informed its creditors it had tosuspend payments on its foreign debt, estimated at more thaneight billion dlrs.    Camdessus said his agency had to study the problems of theIvory Coast but a solution depended on a coordinated effortbetween the country itself, the commercial banks, othergovernments and international finance institutions.    He also disussed problems of developing countries ingeneral with banking and government officials in Abidjan.;unknown

"PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>    MANILA, June 1 - Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later thismonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.    ""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview.    He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position.    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground.    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research.    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether.    ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root.""    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop.    ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" hesaid.    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.    ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""he said.    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.    ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said.    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.    ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romerosaid. He said the government's proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.    ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said.    PCA figures show about one-third of the country'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land.";coconut
"PHILIPPINES APPLAUDS DEFEAT OF U.S. LABELLING BILL<AUTHOR>    By Diane Stormont</AUTHOR>    MANILA, Oct 20 - The Philippine coconut industry hasgreeted with relief the defeat in the U.S. Senate of a billrequiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.    The bill, which was defeated by the Senate AgricultureCommittee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a yearin lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.    ""Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance thebill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to anotherSenate bill,"" a spokesman for the United Coconut Association ofthe Philippines (UCAP).    PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, witheight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.    The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association(ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.    He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue duringthe debate.    ""Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturatedanimal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systemsleaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease,"" he said.    U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued thatsaturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels woulddiscourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favourof domestic unsaturated alternatives.    Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminatedagainst imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia andIndonesia.    The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut productsin 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.    Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible useaccount for about half of that total, PCA's Romero said.";coconut
GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE    ANTWERP, June 18 - The rate of increase in world palm oiluse is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said.    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said.    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm.    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season.    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said.    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth.    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.;cotton-oil

COCOA TERMINAL DEPOSITS TO BE CUT 25 PCT - ICCH    LONDON, April 8 - The basic deposit on cocoa futurescontracts will be reduced by 25 pct as from Friday, April 10,taking the required deposit for one 10 tonne lot to 300 stgfrom 400 previously, a spokesman for the InternationalCommodity Clearing House (ICCH) said.    The deposit for spread contracts will be similarly cut, to150 stg for a one 10 tonne lot from 200 previously, he said.    The ICCH had been looking at cocoa market fluctuations overa period of weeks, he said, adding the market's basic stabilityhad warranted a cut in deposit rates.    The decision to cut deposits was taken by the ICCH afterconsultation with the London Cocoa Terminal Market, thespokesman said.    The cuts were likely to attract more business to themarket, he said.;cocoa
BRAZIL NOT SELLING TO COCOA BUFFER STOCK - TRADE    RIO DE JANEIRO, June 1 - Brazil is not selling cocoa beansto the International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock, asspot prices for beans in the interior area are 20 to 25 pcthigher than levels which would be paid by the ICCO buffer stockmanager, trade sources in the major producing state Bahia said.    The scarcity of beans because of the effects of drought onthe current temporao harvest has pushed prices well aboveinternational levels, the sources noted.    The only buyers are bean exporters or local processorscovering previously contracted commitments, they added.    If sales were made they would be executed by individualexporting companies which are members of the Brazilian CocoaTrade Commission, they said.;cocoa

"BRAZIL COCOA EXPORTERS UNLIKELY TO LIMIT SALES    RIO DE JANEIRO, APRIL 9 - Brazilian cocoa exporters are notlikely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort toboost world prices, trade sources said.    They said a similar procedure was taken in the past inBrazil and that it did not work out according to plans.    ""The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, whichis controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters inBrazil operate at their own free will,"" a trade source said.    The traders were responding to questions whether they wouldfollow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.    The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign TradeDepartment, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market byrejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipmentcriteria.    ""The position of local producers is always to negotiate asthey please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and thinkit's a good deal, they are free to go ahead,"" one source added.";cocoa
"COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES<AUTHOR>    By Roger May, Reuters</AUTHOR>    YAOUNDE, April 8 - Major cocoa exporters are likely tolimit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost worldprices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa ProducersAlliance (CPA) said.    The sources said the depressed world market had been one ofthe main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the11-member CPA which began on Monday.    They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid thebuffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in hiseffort to support prices.    Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreedoperation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in Londonlast month and the stock manager is expected to enter themarket soon.    Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoasurpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager hasto buy cocoa under stock rules.    The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set rangeby buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.    ""The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,""commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.    Another source said that with much of the 1986/87(October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales inthe near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.    The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry inBrazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major WestAfrican producers, where sales are made or authorized bycommodity marketing boards.    The CPA includes the world's top three producers, IvoryCoast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.    The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.";cocoa

The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dryconditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant ifthere is good rainfall in coming weeks.    Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowestin northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop hasespecially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matinsaid.    Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier thismonth 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes,compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.    Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculturehad been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does notneed very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants havebeen affected in some regions, it added.

COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION<AUTHOR>    By Peter Read, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, June 1 - Traders recently returned from West Africasay some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective actionso far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) bufferstock manager on buffer stock purchases.    One trader said some West African producers are annoyed theBuffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by theInternational Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.    So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have beentaken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,only on an intermittent basis.    They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first weekhe bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of thelimitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.    The traders recently returned from West Africa sayproducers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices sofar, noting producing countries are part of the internationalcocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.    London traders say terminal market prices would have togain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day averageindicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or referenceprice).    However, little progress has been made in that direction,and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lowerintervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.    The buffer stock manager may announce today he will bemaking purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of theagreement such action is not automatic, traders said.    Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock managerare not confined to West African producers, they observed.    A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sourcesthere saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with theintermittent buffer stock buying activities.    In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against totalpotential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.Carryover holdings from the previous International CocoaAgreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.    Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne fromFriday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271.    It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent fromthe market, prices go up, while when he declares his intentionto buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.;cocoa
"DUTCH COCOA PROCESSORS UNHAPPY WITH ICCO BUFFER<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Lovell, Reuters</AUTHOR>    ROTTERDAM, June 1 - Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy withthe intermittent buying activities of the International CocoaOrganization's buffer stock manager, industry sources toldReuters.    ""The way he is operating at the moment is doing almostnothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to beactively depressing it,"" one company spokesman said.    Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the totalamount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since herecently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.    Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below whichthe bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.    ""Even before he started operations, traders estimated themanager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnesmaximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level,and yet he appears reluctant to do so,"" one manufacturer said.    ""We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buyup to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simplystep back,"" he added.    ""The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of themarket at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and themarket because everyone is holding back from both buying andselling waiting to see what the manager will do next,"" oneprocessor said.    ""As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market islikely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he isabout to alter his methods,"" he added.    Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer pricesfor cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stockbuying for some time to come.";cocoa
"ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift</AUTHOR>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - Asian cocoa producers are expandingoutput despite depressed world prices and they dismisssuggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.    ""Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their marketfrom our product,"" said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorategeneral of plantations. ""We're happy about our long-term future.""    Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales inAsia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitablefor European tastes.    They were responding to comments by London traders thatlarge tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesiaand Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoaprices.    London traders said the Asian cocoa was consideredunsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and ahigh level of free fatty acids.    Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and theUnited States if it did not produce a type suitable for WesternEurope.    A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said theLondon market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa withhigh-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.    ""When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything totalk down prices,"" the spokesman said.    He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.    PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoayear ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exportedto West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to theNetherlands and Britain.    The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry officialwho wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problemwith quality and would continue to expand sales. He describedcriticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as ""trade politics""and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant itdid not have any difficulty with exports.    Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodityproducers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside theInternational Cocoa Organization (ICCO).    Officials have said Malaysian production is expected tototal 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.    This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because ofthe end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largestcocoa growing area.    Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output isprojected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnesthis year as young trees mature.    Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers andtraders said they could last out low prices longer than WestAfrican countries.    According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices wouldhave to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) tomake cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.    Some traders believe the main quality problem is withharvesting and fermentation techniques.    One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtuallyindistinguishable from West African output if treated in thesame way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysianestates.";cocoa

EC MINISTERS CONSIDER CUTBACKS IN STEEL SUPPORT    LUXEMBOURG, June 1 - A new steel quota system that wouldstrictly limit European Community (EC) support to the industrycould be forced on producers if they fail to find their ownsolution quickly, officials said.    EC industry ministers meeting here considered two keyproposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mlntonnes by 1990.    The first would limit the current quota system, which hasprotected EC output for seven years, only to flat products andheavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel productsinto free market competition.    The second proposal would link continuation of a quotasystem with progress toward plant closures, although less thana month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said theyhad abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily.    The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solutionimmediately, instead urging steel producers to try again toreach agreement on voluntary cutbacks.    The EC Commission has said it will come up with detailedproposals in July on the future of the EC steel industry and ECindustry ministers meet again in September to reach a finaldecision.;iron-steel

"TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 9 - Steel stocks, which have had a healthyrunup recently, still present some short term investmentopportunities, according to some steel analysts.    But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firmprices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will endsoon. They recommend taking profits.    ""It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,"" saidCharles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. ""Orders will bestrong for about two months, and there are signs that some(order rates) are starting to dive already.""    But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison seessome short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp<X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp <BS>, Armco Inc <AS> and Inland SteelIndustries Inc <IAD>.    ""There is still some attractiveness to steels over theshort- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates andrising prices,"" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations tomake them more efficient.    Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues torecommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.    Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balancesheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment businesshas been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradfordnoted. ""It's not a high-quality investment situation yet butthey've come a long way,"" he said.    ""We think the stock will do moderately better than themarket,"" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.    Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,against losses last year.    Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, hesaid.    Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. ""We had a buyon it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else haveit,"" he said.    The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr ashare in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, andfrom two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. ""But a lotdepends on oil prices,"" he added. About 60 pct of USX's salescome from oil and natural gas.    Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum ofSalomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. ""The company's done a lot(of restructuring), more than the market's given them creditfor,"" she said.    She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX wastrading up 1/8 at 28-1/2.

"SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN<AUTHOR>    By Masaru Sato</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, Oct 19 - Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the keysupplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at leastthe next five years, oil industry sources said.    Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane andbutane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on SaudiArabian LPG, the sources said.    They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associateof crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. ""Saudiis a reliable supplier in that sense,"" said one trader.    Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.    No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as anLPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.    ""Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulfcould easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilitiesin that area,"" said another trader.    Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant atAl-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back tocontractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports fromother ports.    Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on cruderather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPGsupply disruptions, traders said.    They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz wasunlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.    Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatlyrise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at amoderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.    Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to liftslightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports fromIndonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.    The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases inlarge scale when Japan increases annual imports of IndonesianLPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in theyear ended March 1987, the sources said.    But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase downterm purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes onthe spot market, they said.    Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under termcontracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct ofJapan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.    Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has madesome concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in therecent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely theJapanese will accept the offer, the sources said.    The Japanese term customers, however, have so far beenunsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula toreplace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.    Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified byPetromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)of Arabian Light.    Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftingsshould the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of ArabianLight's GSP.    Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,the trade sources said.    Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplyingup to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject toseller-buyer agreement.    Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cutsupplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.    ""If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitablebasis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,"" saidan official at a major importer. ""Freight costs are higher forcargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to alonger haul and war risk insurance payments.""    Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month tofinalise their separate contract talks, now focusing oncontractual period and volume, which could be very similar tocurrent levels, the sources said. ""When we talk business, wewould seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability ofhigh dependence on a single supplier,"" said one.";propane

JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT    TOKYO, June 18 - Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.

"SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY    CHICAGO, June 2 - Nearby months in soybean and soymealfutures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply oflivestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep thenew crop outlook bearish, traders said.    ""A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worriedabout where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,""one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers forthe few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with aDecatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bidanother two cents today to 10 over July futures.    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willingto sell, dealers said.    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the beliefthat even if futures rally back to last month's highs, countrymovement may remain light because farmers in many areas aresold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern halfof the Midwest.    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtimefor maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducingthe weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping thespot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help Julysoybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds.

Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose toa record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pcton the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal atseven pct, it said.    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago monthsfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediatelybut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, itestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes byOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposalswere reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mlnat that time last year.;soy-meal

The company said it had been able to cut its losses becauseits scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebustarted in the second half of 1986.    Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisitionby Bond of the company's existing bank loans and theirrestructuring into a gold loan.    A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides inOctober last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.

ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT    LUSAKA, June 1 - The Zambian government today announcedminor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its neweconomic strategy, while police and troops patrolled thenorthern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.    However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,were not affected by the cuts and many people said this couldprovoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected moresweeping reductions.    Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with thesmall extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct onitems such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.    Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone saidgovernment forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.    In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no signof troops or police reinforcements on the streets.    President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to takeaccount of lower import costs following the revaluation of thekwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.    The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economicstrategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerityprogram.    Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs ofunemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatileregion to take action against shops that did not reduce theirprices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed inthe Copperbelt during food riots last December after thegovernment tried to lift maize subsidies.;copper
PHELPS DODGE SEEKS TO DIVERSIFY MORE FROM COPPER    NEW YORK, June 2 - Phelps Dodge Corp is prepared to makeanother large non-copper acquisition and a deal could be struckin the near future, chairman G.

"LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS    New York, June 1 - The elimination of limits on daily pricefluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on theCommodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effecton the market, analysts said.    ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said WilliamO'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.    ""The market has not approached the old price limits andtrading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he said.    On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the twocontracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copperand aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,which were severely tested by a volatile market in silverfutures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the liftingof all daily limits, effective today.    Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs perounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in thenearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.    Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most backmonths, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearbycontracts amid quiet trading today.    During the last week of April, silver futures often tradedat the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, thedollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, orunlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.    As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, manyunmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.    The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrsfor failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.    Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panicbuying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.    O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits wouldadd caution to trading.    ""This is a more realistic approach because the metalsmarket is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""O'Neill said.";copper

"ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT<AUTHOR>    By Buchizya Mseteka, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LUSAKA, June 18 - Zambia's copper mining industry is hopingto achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes ayear in the next few years despite low world prices,deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industryofficials said.    But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a toughInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program hasintroduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructurethe ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.    Copper production by the government-controlled ZambiaConsolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial yearended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from arecord 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.    ""We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financialyear, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes dueto greater availability of spares and equipment,"" a ZCCMofficial said.    ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, anotherstrategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.    Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonneshigher than the previous year and the best production achievedto date.    Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copperindustry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Miningis monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of thecountry's foreign exchange earnings.    Production has also been seriously affected in recent yearsby equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages ofspare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes outputlast year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.    A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the AfricanDevelopment Bank and the World Bank.    The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining andmetallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.    ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, hassaid it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce aspart of the plan.    More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into theindustry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability underthe five-year restructuring plan.    Company officials said although reserves were beingdepleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond theend of the century, though at lower levels of production.    Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit forthe financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mlnkwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level beinglevied, a net loss is likely to be registered.    ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 comparedwith a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.    Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose asthe value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just overtwo to the dollar.    But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished theauctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economicstrategy based on national resources.    ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects thebreak with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.    ""We are still consulting to see how the new measures willaffect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fareunder the new situation,"" Peter Hansen, director of operationsand third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.    Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchangerate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's exportprofits.    ""Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-evenpoint for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,"" FrederickChiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.    High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambianindustry.    Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United Statesand under 40 cents in Chile.    The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambiabeing landlocked. The government confirmed this year it hadstopped sBending copper south through South Africa.    Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, aresent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares andfuel.";copper

Last year, copper demand was second highest onrecord behind 1984, he said.    Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, withannual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.       During the interview, executive vice president DouglasYearley said he believed it was only a matter of time beforethe copper price rose ""because there aren't that many newprojects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,will continue to grow modestly.""    Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound tomore than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a poundrise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings forPhelps Dodge, the company said.

New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mineowned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's<BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge'sown expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by productionshortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.

For the six months following July 1, 1986, when the ventureofficially started production, Highland Valley had total oremilled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pctcopper, Townson said.    Cominco's share of production was 43,000 short tons ofcopper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of Molybdenumin concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces ofgold, he said.    A consortium, 50 pct owned by Teck and 25 pct each by MIM(Canada) Inc and Metallgesellschaft Canada Ltd, acquired itsCominco stake last year from Canadian Pacific Ltd <CP>.";copper
"PHELPS DODGE <PD> SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 2 - Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. RobertDurham said the company is prepared to make another largenon-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in thenear future.    In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company wasexamining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.    He declined to name the companies but said a deal couldoccur as soon as the second half of 1987.       Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer inthe U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian ChemicalsCo, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tiresamong other products.    The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify andeventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copperoperations.    Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrsto buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.       Any acquisition candidate would have to have a differenteconomic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and goodmanagement, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendlydeal, he added.    ""We're not talking high-tech, or financial services orabout a perfume company,"" he said. ""We want a good basicindustrial company that will fit into our managementstructure,"" Durham said.       During the interview, Durham and other executives also saidcontinued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead tohigher prices for the metal.    ""In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price(for copper) will improve because there aren't that many newprojects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,will continue to grow modestly,"" said executive vice presidentDouglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost ofproducing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest andcorporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.    Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound nowcompared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analystssaid.    Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have beenfor almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.    He declined to project results for the second quarter oryear. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise incopper prices in the last month will help results.    Durham said last month that the second quarter should matchthe first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mlndlrs or 49 cts a share.    First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increasedcopper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, alsoacquired last year.    Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.";copper

"PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>    MANILA, June 1 - Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later thismonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.    ""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview.    He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position.    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground.    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research.    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether.    ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root.""    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop.    ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" hesaid.    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.    ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""he said.    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.    ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said.    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.    ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romerosaid. He said the government's proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.    ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said.    PCA figures show about one-third of the country'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land.";copra-cake

He declined to elaborate.    A senior bank official, who declined to be named, toldReuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs atthe end of the year.

"TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY<AUTHOR>    By Chen Chien-Kuo, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TAIPEI, June 19 - Recent government moves to curb capitalinflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan'sforeign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollaragainst the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.    Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters thereserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past twoweeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against theU.S. Dollar.    Chang said, ""The pace of increase in our reserves is muchslower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.""He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surpluswith the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.Dlrs a month between January and May.    The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan andWest Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.    On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings oflocal and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bankpurchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90pct of the value of a contract.    Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures haddrastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange toimporters and exporters.    They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollartransactions showed a drastic decline with some banksregistering a fall of up to 30 pct.    Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised againstthe U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanesecents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of fiveto eight cents in May.    The bank dealers said the central bank, which hadpreviously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercialdemand.    They said they expected the government to keep the localdollar stable in the near term to give breathing space tobusinesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise ofmore than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar sinceSeptember 1985.    The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,unchanged from yesterday.    Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,""It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflowis quite successful.""    Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slowerrise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure fromWashington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.    Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayedimports of machinery and production equipment because ofexchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange ratewould help boost imports, particularly from the United States.";reserves

Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrsat end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.

"U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, June 18 - Today's U.K. Economic data have pushedthe chances of another base lending rate cut from the currentnine pct further into the distance, analysts said.    A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturingproduction data showed that the economy is still strong anddoes not need a fillip from lower rates.    News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,taken together with higher than expected bank lending and moneysupply growth, revived inflation worries and monetaristarguments against easier credit, they said.    ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed backall the while. The strength of the economy and broad moneygrowth are making it more difficult to see one in the nearterm,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.    Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday'smortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societiessaid were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.Rates.    It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week thata post-general election cut was imminent, supported by suchoptimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise whichmirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling'sstrength.    The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasmabout May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemploymentrate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidlyreplaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlyingaverage earnings in April, dealers said.    The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lendingrose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bankof England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offsetthe impact on domestic money supply of its currentintervention.    ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.    ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a verygood state indeed,"" Skeoch said.    ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationarypressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost riseswere better than expected, just one pct higher in the year toApril, and it was these costs rather than average earningswhich were potentially inflationary, he added.    ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a majorproblem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.    But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worriedabout the funding implications of recent intervention.    He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assetsearlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes thatthe ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, nowlooks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities tryto prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.    However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort GrievesonSecurities, said any fresh sterling strength would stilltrigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signalhigher inflation this year.    ""Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. Aslong as that continues we're okay,"" he added.";reserves
"U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT<AUTHOR>    By Rowena Whelan, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LONDON, June 2 - The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for afurther cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11general election, market analysts said.    Sterling would have risen on the much better than expectednumber but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.    But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves nowavailable to the authorities to support the pound should curbany market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show theruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.    ""We have been intervening to a very much greater extent thanwe have done hitherto,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawsonsaid at a news conference today, commenting on the news of therecord reserves rise.    He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvreaccord between leading industrial nations to stabilise thedollar, partly through direct intervention on foreignexchanges. ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" hesaid.    But market analysts see the recent upward pressure onsterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp downits rise, more in the light of local factors.    Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britainamid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears lastautumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.    U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreignbuyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields asattractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notablyequities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.    Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lowerinterest rates, as the government is expected to try to reversethe loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.    Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reservesnews, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket ofcurrencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.    ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of theelection,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.    Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts ofa rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs hadoverestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely tohave been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on theforward market.    The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount ofsterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooththe pound's sudden downturn, while some of the interventionreported in May probably occurred in April, they said.    The key three months interbank money market rates easedabout 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrendin U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reservesnews, analysts said.    Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market wasmuted as traders worried about the funding implications ofanother huge rise in reserves, they added.    Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cutfrom the current nine pct level soon after the election, solong as poll projections of another Conservative victory proveaccurate, with another half point later.    Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit SuisseBuckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might bepossible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts infuture, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted.    Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautionedagainst over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cutlooked likely.    A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.    ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the politicalproblem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... Andhas signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said RobinMarshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.    He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves inthe past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into theEuropean Monetary System.    But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they didso. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.";reserves

""We have said all along that the rubber is holding up wellfrom a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored inproper conditions does not deteriorate,"" he told Reuters in atelephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber soldsince he entered the market in September would be discussed atan INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.    Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest inbuying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possiblepoor quality.    Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the""may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO'sfive-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stockwas uppermost in consumers' minds.    ""We have received good interest for the rubber. I understandthe Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubberbefore they carry on buying,"" he said.    Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 differentlocations in producing and consuming nations, adding allwarehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.    Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during thepast week to 10 days and this could reflect a ""wait and seeattitude"" by buyers, he said.    ""Consumers are holding back from buying additional amountsuntil they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,they are likely to buy more."" Hofmeister said he could reducethe offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interestbut INRO did not want to depress prices artificially.    Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimatesthat he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpurand New York since September.    But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have anidea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overallhad put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.    The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonnebuffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Councilmeeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday.    The current international rubber pact expires on October22.    The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 andHofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber duringthe interim period.";rubber

MAJOR RUBBER PRODUCERS TO MEET IN SINGAPORE    SINGAPORE, April 9 - Officials from Indonesia, Malaysia,Singapore and, perhaps, Thailand will meet here tomorrow todiscuss increased regional cooperation on rubber marketing andways to raise rubber prices, industry sources said.    The officials will discuss linking rubber markets in thefour countries to improve price transparency, the sources said.    This is the first time Indonesia is attending such ameeting, they said, but representatives from Thailand may notbe able to attend because of their tight schedule. Malaysia,Indonesia and Thailand account for 90 pct of world rubberexports and Singapore is a major regional rubber tradingcentre.    The Malaysian Rubber Futures market, freighting andcontracts for rubber are among other issues expected to bediscussed.

"INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>    JAKARTA, April 8 - The Indonesian Commodity Exchange islikely to start trading in at least one new commodity, andpossibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman PaianNainggolan said.    He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading inpalm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.    Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oilmay also be introduced. But he said the question was stillbeing considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and nodecision on when to go ahead had been made.    The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubberphysicals on an open outcry system four days a week.    ""Several factors make us move cautiously,"" Nainggolan said.""We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make amistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.""    Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffeeadded in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up tofive months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five aretraded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,exchange officials said.    The trade ministry and exchange board are considering theintroduction of futures trading later for rubber, but oneofficial said a feasibility study was needed first. Nodecisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April23, traders said.    Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as theworld's second largest producer of natural rubber, shouldexpand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development ofthe exchange would help this.    Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boostoverseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.    He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan toencourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation wouldalso visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states toencourage participation.

"BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING    SAN FRANCISCO, June 18 - A trade-led boom in the U.S. isunlikely this year or next because growth in net exports willmerely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending andother sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in itslatest economic report.    Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending willcontribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.    ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said.    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.    The report was released before the Commerce Departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before.    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.    ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said.    Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on animprovement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes onthe rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" headded.";housing
"INTEREST RATES HURT U.S. MAY HOUSING SALES<AUTHOR>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 29 - Sales of new single-family homestumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of highermortgage interest rates, analysts said.    ""There should be another month or two of very weak new homesales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homesshould become more stable by mid-summer,"" said economistLawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.    The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the CommerceDepartment said.    Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out atabout 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.    The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers outof the market, he and others said.    ""The rates moved very suddenly and were certainlyunexpected by homebuyers,"" said Cynthia Latta, an economistwith Data Resources. ""They were so startled, they wanted tohold back and see what would happen.""    The drop in sales of new single-family home sales wassharper than expected, some economists said. ""We fully expecteda decline but the extent was more than we anticipated,"" saidJames Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions.    Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales ofexisting homes, which are generally less expensive than newhomes.    Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of newcondominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast werereflected in sales of existing but not new homes.    Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,""Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the marketis going to stabilize and give us a good second half.""    Others were less optimistic, however.    ""We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but Idon't think this is the start of a collapse in single-familyhousing,"" said Chimerine of Wharton.    Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home LoanBank of New York, said, ""The lower sales level will bemaintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.There won't be much specific improvement in coming months.""";housing

"DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY<AUTHOR>    By Marcel Michelson, Reuters</AUTHOR>    AMSTERDAM, June 1 - A cut of about half a percentage pointin Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, althougheconomists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.    Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and widepremiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.    Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advancesrate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped itsrepurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.    That rate has remained in force, just holding above thefive pct official secured loans rate which governs commercialbank borrowings.    Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West Germanrepo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.    In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate tothree pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered moneymarket rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loansrate on lending under its three month credit quota.    Since then, however, both the Central Bank and FinanceMinistry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.    In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said hewould follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the FinanceMinistry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billionguilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pctfor an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.    Technically, analysts said, there has to be a differencebetween the secured loans rate which applies to lending underthe credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which addextra liquidity to the money market.    Bank economists and dealers said a West German move tofurther lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts wouldresult in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.    The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around itsparity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673guilders per 100 marks.    Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a levelthat would not permit a change in the interest ratedifferential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealerssaid.    An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German andDutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, hesaid new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflationexpectations which would put upward pressure on interest ratesin the longer term.    In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,or even negative, while the latest official economic forecastspoint to a falling rate of economic growth.    ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreementnegotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""the ABN economist said.    He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct inJanuary, could also contribute to some inflation.    At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run totwo pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in thesecond half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.    Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buyingspree on the bond market which would bring yields down,probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall belowfive pct.    Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct inthe money market.";dfl

GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE    ANTWERP, June 18 - The rate of increase in world palm oiluse is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said.    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said.    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm.    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season.    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said.    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth.    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.;soy-oil

MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET    KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 - Malaysia is unlikely to meet itstargeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.    Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliserand overstressed palms, they said.    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil Worldnewsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely todrop sharply this year.    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell morepalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage theindustry, a leading grower told Reuters.    The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnesagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said.    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this yeardue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expectedto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oiloutput peaks.    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new treesagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reductionwill not be felt for about another three years.;soy-oil

SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES    MADRID, April 9 - The head of Spain's employers'federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worriedabout the government's monetary policies because high realinterest rates were hampering investment.    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far thisyear were not endangering the government's five pct inflationtarget. The government's perceived need to control inflation bykeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.    High real interest rates were attracting an influx ofspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting thegovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and atarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call moneyrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from11.8 at end-1986.    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call tohold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and newwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanishworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected thestate sector, where the government is trying to impose its fivepct wage ceiling.    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend inSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the firsttwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pctincrease over the corresponding period last year.    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of thepeseta to correct the imbalance.;money-supply

"FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY<AUTHOR>    By Kathleen Hays, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 18 - New U.S. Banking data suggest theFederal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady pathand is not signalling any imminent change of course, economistssaid.    But they also said that if money supply growth remainsweak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 declinesuggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen itscredit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetarypolicy.    A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced aforecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to adecline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrsto 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.    Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 forthe week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply hasfallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,economists said.    ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivanof Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.    While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator ofeconomic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concernedthe latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growthin the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seenas better gauges of economic growth.    Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, bothmeasures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.    If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.    ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current openmarket position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the endof tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.""    Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowingsof 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement periodwere lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed hadtargetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.    But they said that if it had not been for a large one-daynet miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higherborrowings target would probably have been reached.    A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness inauto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices hashelped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.    ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fedeasing at some point,"" he said.    Other economists said the Fed would probably pay littleattention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number ofyears since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in theeconomy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy isfalling apart and the Fed should ease.""    Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be aprerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetarypolicy.    They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term ratesfor fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar andhigher inflation which would push up long-term yields and chokeoff econmomic growth.    But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since lateApril. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents afundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this givesthem more room to ease,"" he said.";money-supply
"FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY<AUTHOR>    By Alan Wheatley, Reuters</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, April 23 - U.S. banking data released today aretoo distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetarypolicy, but they do support the market's assumption that theFederal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,economists said.    ""It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discountwindow borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rateaverage and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistentwith a modest tightening,"" said Dana Johnson of First ChicagoCorp.    Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate thatthe Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.    Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-weekstatement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week ofDecember 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.    Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billiondlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total thisyear - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at theFed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more inreserves than the Fed had anticipated.    However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fedis aiming for much lower discount window borrowings thanwitnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may haveforced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.    First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the weekended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of theproceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions topay annual income taxes.    As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do thereserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.    Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billiondlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economistssaid the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of theprojected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started toadd reserves too late.    Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparentlyleft Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with whichto enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economistssaid. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of reposoutstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to addeven more reserves but was prevented from doing so.    ""It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add asmuch as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,""said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.    McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targettingdiscount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.    After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has nottightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of thestatement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.    Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced thatthe Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today'sfigures, he said, ""It's fair to say that the Fed may be movingtoward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.""    Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rateunless the dollar's fall gathers pace.    Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing politicalopposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a timewhen Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key toreducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.";money-supply

"GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY    BONN, April 13 - Four of West Germany's five leadingeconomic research institutes warned that excessive monetarygrowth threatened a resurgence of inflation.    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, saidthe expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did notnecessarily threaten stability.    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in whichthree -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise inGNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome inview of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience hasshown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a pricerise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears mayseem exaggerated, they said.    ""But it has often turned out in the past that the priceclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank intoa restrictive policy,"" they said.    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy areless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.    The four institutes disputed the view that monetaryexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domesticinvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital marketinvestments following lower interest rates.    ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion ofcentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to asmaller expansion of money supply,"" they said.    A return to growth and stability did not requirespectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly withopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoidan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not befocused simply on growth of production potential. Because ofuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economicweakness other factors should be taken into account.    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cutsand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluationspeculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threatin itself to price stability.    The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growthreflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and thefalling mark.";money-supply

"FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER    WASHINGTON, April 8 - Robert Heller, a member of theFederal Reserve Board, said he expects ""more modest levels"" ofgrowth in the money supply this year.    ""In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also amost desireable development,"" he said in a speech prepared fordelivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,Calif.    A text was released in Washington.    He said the effect of lower inflation and financialderegulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.    ""Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modestlevels,"" Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowedafter mid-January.    ""I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregateswere to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year aswell,"" he added.    Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.    ""The pricing behavior of American producers in response toprice increases of their foreign competitors will be crucialfor our economic future,"" he said.    Widespread domestic price rises in response to risingimport prices would ""generalize the inflationary forcesemanating from the foreign trade sector"" and might not gain moremarket share for U.S. producers.    ""A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well bethe result of such a behavior pattern,"" Heller warned.    He said ""we at the Federal Reserve will have to bedisciplined in our conduct of monetary policy.""     Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscaldiscipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint ratherthan new taxes.    ""The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindleinflation and certainly would not make us more competitive ininternational markets,"" Heller said.    He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pctduring 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.    A free trade agreement currently being negotiated withCanada ""would be exceedingly helpful in allowing Americanproducers to compete more effectively in that country,"" Hellersaid.";money-supply

U.K. POTATO FUTURES TRADING NOT TO BE SUSPENDED    LONDON, April 9 - Trading on the London potato futuresmarket will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of theLondon Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statementto floor members.    It was in response to strong representations by the PotatoMarketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion ofprice which they say will result in large deliveries into thephysical market when the April futures position expires.    The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futurestrading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore therelationship between futures and physicals.    Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and corneringof the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigationsby the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), theInternational Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and otherparties, found no evidence to substantiate this.    The main complaint from some sections of the physicalmarket is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium overthe PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded thismorning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB'saverage price of 104 stg.    Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there isa two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said qualitypotatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been payingbetween 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesserquality grades have traded below 100 stg.    Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be deliveredagainst the April futures contract between now and the end ofthe month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.    Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the managementcommittee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpracticeand he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.;potato

"LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune</AUTHOR>    Tokyo, April 17 - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngopens talks with Japanese government officials today well awarehis demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrusmarkets is likely to be rejected.     But in an interview with Reuters during the flight toTokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw aninternational spotlight on Japan's agricultural importprotection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to openits markets.    ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, butthey are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said.    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessionsduring Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessionswould be unveiled later this month, they said.    ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (PrimeMinister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when hevisits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports bypartially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last weekrequesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial usessuch as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, sayingTokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota forbeef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers wouldlike to buy much more beef than currently allowed.    He cited the example of a California company whichtransports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter tocircumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher thanthe value of the animal, he said.    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry PromotionCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrowfrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japanhas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan toeliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice byApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventuallybe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges becauseliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanesemandarin orange industry.    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate becauseimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. AndJapanese officials have said.   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buysurplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks inGeneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certainminor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.";orange
U.S. AGENCY RULES AGAINST BRAZIL ORANGE JUICE    WASHINGTON, April 13 - The U.S. International TradeCommission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department toimpose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozenconcentrated orange juice.    The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition inits final ruling on the matter.    Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the CommerceDepartment's final ruling of March 9, and activates ananti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozenconcentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigatorsaid.    The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports haveinjured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had alreadyruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decisionlast fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.    The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted onimports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice sinceCommerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.    Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.    Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons ofBrazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.    Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallontariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.    An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its finalreport on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.    Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order andtransmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entriesdating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessingduties, Vastagh said.    He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,including three major shippers, would be affected by thedecision.;orange

"BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING    SAN FRANCISCO, June 18 - A trade-led boom in the U.S. isunlikely this year or next because growth in net exports willmerely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending andother sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in itslatest economic report.    Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending willcontribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.    As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.    ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will dropdramatically this year because the jump in inflation will causea falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said.    Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.    The report was released before the Commerce Departmentreported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personalconsumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared witha 0.6 pct increase the month before.    The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boostconsumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.    This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.    As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing powerof an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrsthis year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.    The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housingstarts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.    ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said.    Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on animprovement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes onthe rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" headded.";gnp

GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, accordingto a government economic survey.     The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentumand there was an impressive performance in a five pointgovernment program for rural uplift, education and povertyalleviation, said the survey.    Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a newsconference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstormsdamaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pctcompared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might nowslide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.

But the at the same time, homeremittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrsfrom the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.    More exports and an improvement in the balance of paymentssituation will be required to overcome this declining trend inhome remittances, he said.    The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because ofthe boost in exports.    He said national investment continued to be small becauseof a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP.

But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economywas higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.    While noting that the government is bringing forward a fivebillion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that ""themedium to longer-term performance of the West German economycould be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allowrelatively lower tax rates.""    Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German FederalStatistics Office has released figures showing that the GNPactually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter ofthis year compared with the final three months of 1986.    Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appearedlikely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any ofthe Group of Seven leading industrial nations.    West Germany's current account surplus, the target ofconsiderable criticism by the Reagan administration, isexpected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in1988.";gnp
"BANGEMANN REJECTS CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS    BONN, April 13 - West German Economics Minister MartinBangemann indirectly rejected a call from the country's leadingeconomic research institutes for early introduction of a majortax reform involving gross tax cuts of 44 billion marks.    In a statement reacting to the five institutes' jointspring report, Bangemann said that as far as the call forbringing forward the 1990 tax reform was concerned --    ""The government points out that the positive effects forgrowth of its policy of consolidation (cutting the budgetdeficit) must not be allowed to be endangered.""    Bangemann also recalled that the scope of tax cuts plannedfor 1988 had already been increased.    Three institutes predicted two pct economic growth in 1987,with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pctgrowth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.    Bangemann said ""The government, agreeing with the majority,sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate forexports expressed by the minority.""    He said there was reason to believe that export demandwould start to rise in the course of the year, partly becauseof a further increase in world trade.";gnp
"INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY    BONN, April 13 - The five leading West German economicresearch institutes have failed to agree about how strongly thedomestic economy will expand this year but revised downforecasts contained in a report published six months ago.    The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essenpredicted in the institutes' joint spring report that grossnational product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, comparedwith 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecastthree pct 1987 growth in October last year.    Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlinand Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.    The joint report said that the estimates of economicdevelopment made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly lessfavourable"" than those of the other three.    The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after aslow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will,however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said.    The two institutes said external economic factors whichwere currently damaging exports and pushing up imports woulddominate the economic environment throughout the year. They sawexports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted nomarked improvement in the course of the year.    The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline indemand and production (seen) in the winter months does notindicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.""    They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporateuncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.But they expected that many investments had not been cancelledbut only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions(on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.""    They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuationof the economic uptrend are still favourable.""    These three institutes said diminishing external burdenscombined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn indemand and production could be expected by the spring.    However, this projection was clouded by risks including thefurther development of the mark against the dollar.    Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said thatwhile exports would continue to be the weak point of theeconomy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exportswill soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge duringthe course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fallin exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.    The three more positive institutes saw private consumptionrising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.    They saw the climate for equipment investment improving butpredicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.    All the institutes predicted only a slight decline inunemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said thejobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people inwork of about 200,000.    These three institutes said new jobs would be createdmainly in the private services sector and also by the state inthe context of job creation measures. The construction industrywas likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980but they predicted either no rise in employment in themanufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.    The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur onlyin the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in themanufacturing industry will decline.""    The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.    They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw acurrent account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marksand predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.    The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start torise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all fivepredicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.";gnp
"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY<AUTHOR>    By Rory Channing, Reuters</AUTHOR>    KUWAIT, April 8 - Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-riddeneconomy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil priceswill determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economistssay.    Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to holdoil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in thenorthern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.    Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of grossdomestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last yearafter contracting 8.1 pct the year before.    This was after taking into account inflation in consumerprices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.    Factors depressing economic activity include the6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, whichthreatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through theGulf and has sapped business confidence.    But sentiment received a much-needed boost in Septemberwhen, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisiscaused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensivenew debt settlement program was introduced.    The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forwardtrading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.    The cheques were also used as collateral for consumerspending, thus generating an informal credit system.    Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums arestill owed by individuals and companies.    There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of whichone-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank asbad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said itwill not allow any banks to go under.    The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling ofproblem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whetherdebtors have regular cash flows or not.    Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rightsguaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significancein a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sectoris the biggest after oil.    Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to rideout the oil glut, bankers and economists say.    Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned lastyear by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.    But strategic diversification into downstream operations inEurope several years ago and a hefty refining investment athome gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sellover one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.    Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processedproduct such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than ascrude.    Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reasonfor cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domesticinflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recentyears and signs government spending on productive sectors willremain steady.    External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct belowthat for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hitGulf.    Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were putofficially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment incomeof the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.    But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, thesereserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit forthe 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.    In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.    This left out income from state reserves, usually excludedin official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers atup to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in someshortfall.    Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast foreconomic growth this year or next.    ""It depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""This summer isimportant.""    Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sundaythe cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise statespending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate theeconomy.    He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to bespelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.";gnp

"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST CUT SPENDING, ANZ SAYS    SYDNEY, April 13 - The government must announce harsh cutsin spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to givean adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZBanking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> said.    Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against thebackdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthlyBusiness Indicators publication.    ""For the past two years, the government has struggled withan economic reality that demands measures beyond those which itsees as politically practicable,"" it said.    The political climate meant there would be a continuedover-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate andmaintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.    ""The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revivalof business investment will be further postponed,"" it said.    The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted byexport and import-replacement industries which had created afalse suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance ofpayments crisis were past.

"GERMAN EXPERTS SAY NO FURTHER ECONOMIC STIMULUS    BONN, June 2 - The West German government's independentcouncil of economic experts believes a further stimulation ofthe economy is inappropriate, government spokesman FriedhelmOst said.    A statement released by Ost after a meeting of ChancellorHelmut Kohl and senior government officials with the councilsaid the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to twopct was achievable.    It added the council believed ""an intensification of thealready expansionary stimulation of monetary and financialpolicy is not called for.""    Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure onWest Germany to adapt to external economic factors would notincrease.    The government regularly uses the term ""changed externaleconomic factors"" when referring to the fall of the dollar,which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officialshave said they expect exports to pick up during the year, butcould still fall below the 1986 level.    Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germanyagreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris inFebruary aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.    The stance taken by the experts backs up the officialposition of the West German government ahead of next week'sseven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to bepressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.    West German government officials have stressed Bonn is notin a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts duenext year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.    The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in officialinterest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.    The experts' prediction for economic growth this year ofbetween 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from aforecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.    Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987predictions in light of the downturn in exports.

"HIGHER SPENDING EXPECTED IN MALAYSIA'S 1988 BUDGET<AUTHOR>    By Ho Wah Foon</AUTHOR>    KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 19 - Malaysia's recovery from the worstrecession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when thegovernment announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988after seven years of austerity, economists said.    ""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh,an economist with the Institute of Strategic and InternationalStudies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment forfaster growth if the private sector is not moving.""    Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinkingone pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.    The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be undertwo pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pctbecause prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin andsemiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.    The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billionringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.    Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pctin 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.    Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmenblaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.    One businessman said too many politicians give theimpression that Malaysia was unstable.

"SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS<AUTHOR>    By Tony Barber</AUTHOR>    MOSCOW, Oct 19 - The Soviet Union outlined its economictargets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improvestandards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.    Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Sovietindustrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from aplanned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.    Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalentto gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against aplanned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures theoutput of a country's goods and services.    He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes ofgrain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscowproduced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.    Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has describedmachine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization isessential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively onworld markets.    ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in themachine-building industry. The economy is not receiving aconsiderable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" saidTalyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.    Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makesmachine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987compared with the same period last year.    However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase plannedfor the industry for the whole of 1988.    Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recentmeeting that an improvement in economic performance depended toa large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scalemeasures are planned to save resources,"" he said.    Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet thatdefense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the samefigure as was announced last year.    Western governments view official Soviet estimates fordefense spending as highly understated, but say the real figureis hard to calculate because Soviet military industries areintertwined with the civilian economy.    Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spendingnext year on medical services, education, pensions and socialinsurance schemes.";gnp
"GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY    BONN, April 13 - Four of West Germany's five leadingeconomic research institutes warned that excessive monetarygrowth threatened a resurgence of inflation.    But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, saidthe expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did notnecessarily threaten stability.    The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in whichthree -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise inGNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.    The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome inview of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience hasshown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a pricerise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.    Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears mayseem exaggerated, they said.    ""But it has often turned out in the past that the priceclimate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank intoa restrictive policy,"" they said.    The economic costs of a preventive stability policy areless than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.    The four institutes disputed the view that monetaryexpansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domesticinvestors switch liquidity into longer term capital marketinvestments following lower interest rates.    ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion ofcentral bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to asmaller expansion of money supply,"" they said.    A return to growth and stability did not requirespectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly withopen market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoidan interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.    The DIW institute said monetary policy should not befocused simply on growth of production potential. Because ofuncertainty about exchange rate developments and economicweakness other factors should be taken into account.    Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cutsand avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluationspeculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threatin itself to price stability.

"OECD URGES ACTION TO CUT U.S. BUDGET DEFICIT    PARIS, June 18 - The United States should take urgentaction to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possiblereductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs ongrowth of the defense budget, the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development said.    The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congressquickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit ""could seriouslyaffect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.""    It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,running until September 30 this year, would substantiallyovershoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billiondlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.    ""The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions ofslower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for thefirst half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190billion dollars,"" it said.    While this would be 30 billion lower than last year'sdeficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate taxincreases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.    The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.    In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exportsboosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.    Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the servicesector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to beheading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumerprices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct nextyear after just 2.1 pct in 1986.    ""Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factorsbehind the avoidance of recession,"" the report said.    The current account balance of payments deficit is expectedto be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, afterhitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.    In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightlyto around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but willstill be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation isexpected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pctthis year.

"JOINT ACTION SAID VITAL TO BOOST WORLD GROWTH    PARIS, June 18 - Prospects for world economic growth remainvery sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments isurgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilizecurrencies and encourage investment, the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.    ""The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large paymentsimbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of itsgloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.    The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc ofwestern industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's2.5 pct growth rate.    ""We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD areacomfortably exceeding three pct,"" David Henderson, head of theOECD's economics and statistics department, said.    The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to risinginflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third worlddebt problem to increase the risks of a world economicdownturn.    ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growthremain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most majorcountries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interestrates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexiblelabor markets.    But private sector confidence had been undermined byuncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""forconfidence to be restored, it is important for governmentsswiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.""    This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accordof the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.    The OECD said that apparent disagreements among majorcountries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped toundermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscalpolicies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demandin the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.    Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announcedrecently by the Japanese government to encourage public worksand cut taxes would make a significant contribution to thisprocess, though it was too early to estimate its preciseimpact.    He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domesticdemand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.    The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, hasworsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecastto rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pctincrease in 1986.    There is no prospect for any significant improvement in theunemployment situation over the next 18 months, with theaverage rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to lastyear.

ITALIAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK LESS BRIGHT, OECD SAYS    PARIS, June 19 - Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightlylower growth, higher unemployment and an increased tradedeficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment (OECD) said.    But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast aslightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Lastyear Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growingeconomies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.    The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.    The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around fivepct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround inimport prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labourcosts and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the reportsaid.    This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demandshould be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumptionmade possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.    Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration inItalian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports andadversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result ina sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.;gnp
HIGHER GROWTH, UNEMPLOYMENT IN FRANCE, OECD SAYS    PARIS, June 19 - France's growth rate is expected tostrengthen in the second half of this year after a poor firsthalf, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECDforecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said therate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantlyhigher than in the first half of this year.    The OECD said France's economic situation has deterioratedsomewhat during the early months of 1987.     Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventoryadjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflationhas reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely toreach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.    The report said inflation should slow and domestic demandpick up in the second half of this year. But both data arelikely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.    The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices forthe second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first sixmonths. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pctfor the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.;gnp
"GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS<AUTHOR>    By Alver Carlson, Reuters</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - The global economy is expected toweaken this year, adding new worries to an already seriouspoverty outlook, economic analysts said.    For finance ministers and central bankers attending thisweek's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fundand World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add anadditional concern.    The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pctthis year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.    In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, ameasure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.    For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0pct from 3.5 pct last year.    The new figures are considered a major disappointment tothe poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in theindustrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oilprices would assist their economic recovery and help them copewith growing mounds of debt.    IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believedthe industrial country economies would move up to an annualgrowth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.    Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for sometime that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning intoan economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.    Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthierstates for markets for their products as well as financialassistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' economies poses fundamental worries.    Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, haveonly a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,including the key one of exports.    The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but ittoo is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only2.3 pct, according to the IMF.    For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, theUnited States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany toignite their economies but with little apparent success.    The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar andthe curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. tradedeficit.    Reagan administration officials have been saying that theimpact is now beginning to show up, although it has been muchslower than expected.    The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that ""it hasto be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time towork through to payments flows -- probably at least three yearsto get a resonably complete effect.""    The report added, however, ""the adjustments may take evenmore time on this occasion.""REUTER^M";gnp
"GERMAN GNP FIGURES PUBLICATION DELAYED    WIESBADEN, June 2 - Figures for first quarter 1987 WestGerman GNP will be published on June 11 after they wereprovisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the FederalStatistics Office said.    The official said there had been a delay in gatheringinformation for the data, which are expected to show that theWest German economy contracted in the period.    A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said therewas no political motivation behind publishing the figures onJune 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.    ""There is no political motivation. It is a purely technicalmatter,"" he added.    The West German government is expected to come underpressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partnersto stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing internationaltrade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.    However, government officials have ruled out any furthertax reduction packages to supplement a major program ofstimulatory fiscal measures already underway.    Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West Germancentral bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, thewidest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in realterms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the firstquarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.     The government has confirmed that growth was negative inthe first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected tobe about two pct.    Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance tocut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,at three pct, is just above historical lows.    West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venicesummit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,is already outstripping export performance, which has sufferedfrom an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just overtwo years.    The government has pointed out that depressed exports arethe main reason for the current weakness in the economy, butsays that later in the year stronger domestic demand willcompensate for this setback.    It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just undertwo pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.";gnp
"PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS<AUTHOR>    By Pascal Fletcher, Reuters</AUTHOR>    LISBON, April 13 - Portugal's economy, which has beenenjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latestgovernment crisis, analysts said.    But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal CavacoSilva's government could slow economic reforms and investmentas Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the EuropeanCommunity, which it joined in January last year, they said.    Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, wastoppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.    The centre-right administration had made economic growthreform a priority in its 17 months in office.    In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its currentaccount surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs andinflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.    Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instabilitywere worrying but they felt the foundations for continuedgrowth had not been badly shaken.    ""The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that isnow less dependent on the political situation,"" said FritzHaser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.    ""The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,"" economistJorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.    Businessmen have identified political instability over thelast 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lastingeconomic progress.    The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974revolution.    Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remainbuoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surgein economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largelyunderpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.    Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank ofPortugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growthwould remain at similar levels this year.    But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policiesand could slow economic development.    Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the endof the month, can either call early elections or form a newgovernment from parties in the existing left wing-dominatedparliament.    Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quickelections as the best solution. ""There is a good chance that amajority government could result from early elections,""Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president PedroFerraz da Costa said.    He said they were optimistic this could mean thecontinuation in the near future of liberalisation policiesintroduced over the last year.    The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, butthe PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion pollssay they could win an overall majority.    A PSD majority would also open the way for morewide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws andpossible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.    Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition partiesof blocking key economic reforms.    The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic resultswere more the product of favourable international conditionssuch as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSDpolicies.";gnp
"S.AFRICA EXPECTED TO UNVEIL EXPANSIONARY BUDGET<AUTHOR>    By Christopher Wilson, Reuters</AUTHOR>    CAPE TOWN, June 2 - South Africa is expected to unveiltomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive yearin a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,economic analysts said.    Faced with competing demands for increased military andpolice spending and the pressing need for more funds for blackhousing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis isexpected to raise significantly the government's overallexpenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,the analysts said.    Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in statespending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for thefinancial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleasfrom the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.    ""Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, butsimply raising government spending and increasing the budgetdeficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,"" said Rob Lee,chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.    South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjustedgrowth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year ofless than one pct.    Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled toover 30 pct.    Economists estimate that the government's spending targetwill rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted ataround 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficitbefore borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct ofGDP.    The government, having consistently overshot its ownspending targets for more than a decade, also faces acredibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in thebudget, analysts said.    ""The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,""said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.    Many analysts in the private sector are now paying lessattention to the figures presented in the budget and are usingtheir own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for themoney and capital markets.    South African Mutual's Lee believes government spendingwill again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by theIMF.    ""The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,"" predictedone analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily awayfrom austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the pasttwo years.    The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in thepolitical situation and the onset of an economic crisistriggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll overloans to the country in September 1985.    Against a background of Western economic sanctions, fallingper capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,government officials say economic growth is the primeobjective.    But private-sector economists caution that the government'sability to promote growth by boosting state spending isconstrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on thecurrent account of the country's balance of payments.    Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on thenation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of anarrangement reached earlier this year with major internationalcreditor banks.    Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis haslittle room to manoeuvre.    Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries andbudgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office andSouth African Transport Services suggest that major taxconcessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.    Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessionsfor taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-onlyelection. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.    ""This will not be a very exciting budget,"" commented HarrySchwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal ProgressiveFederal Party. ""I do not expect any major tax cuts as all thesweets were given out before the election.""";gnp
"U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS<AUTHOR>    By Kenneth Barry, Reuters</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - The economy faces lackluster growthand the risk of recession this year if the recent improvementin U.S. exports should falter, economists say.    Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weaknessin the key housing and auto sectors and could be furtherhampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.    ""These factors raise the question: Is there enough strengthto keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"" said LyleGramley, chief economist of the Mortgage BankersAssociation and a former Federal Reserve Board official.    The Commerce Department said this week that the economygrew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, buta U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.    Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spendingrose a weak 0.1 per cent.    ""Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, ""Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,told Reuters.    Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slowbecause inflation is rising faster than real wages.    To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boostpersonal income and consumption, he says.    ""I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports tokeep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,""Gramley said.    Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reportersthat the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was theresult of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not lastand said the recovery was showing anemia.    Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, ""The paceof the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored intomonetary policy"" - possibly a signal that the Fed will beaccommodative.    Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pctforecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that ifthe dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and addto the risk of a recession.    Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in Maycame despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where aninventory overhang still exists.    He says the boost in production came from smallerindustries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which haveimproved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.    ""They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge ineconomic activity, but I think they will keep us out of arecession,"" Mauro said.    In a speech to financial planners this week, BerylSprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted thetrade deficit will continue to improve.    ""Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 andinto 1988 are still quite favorable,"" he said.    But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence ininflation.    Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman BrothersInc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 aftera 1.1 pct increase in 1986.    The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oiland energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.    ""The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie getsout of the bottle, it continues to persist,"" he said, adding hewould like the Fed to tighten credit.    A major factor affecting inflation is the value of thedollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, saysa prominent international banker.    Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the NationalPress Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen andthe mark will continue for years because the United States isthe world's largest debtor nation.    The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to afurther slackening of activity and called naive the belief thatthe five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.""It is very difficult to be optimistic,"" Gut said.";gnp
"NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER<AUTHOR>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, June 2 - Bundesbank vice president HelmutSchlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.    With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down inMay and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that afurther cut in interest rates was needed.    The economy is picking up, after contracting by aseasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter fromthe fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp startingin the second quarter,"" he said in an interview.    Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has beenpressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost itsimports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.    Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter wasmainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.    He estimated that economic growth for the year as a wholewould probably be between one and two pct.   ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domesticdemand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interestrates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.    Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank moneystock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year paceof 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to sixpct target.    He said the target could still be achieved but much willdepend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavyinflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMSrevaluation, boosted domestic money supply.    ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow offoreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bitreversed,"" Schlesinger said.    A major reason for the inflows was the market's convictionthat the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market,expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark havediminished,"" Schlesinger said.    The recent widening of interest rate differentials, thefact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short periodand an improvement in real trade balances have all combinedtowards stabilizing the dollar, he said.    Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollarrise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.    At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.    ""Central banks are always in contact about thesefluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,""Schelsinger said.    ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the Americancase.""    He said that the West German export industry has been hithard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to seesome correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-termfluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see.""    ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a veryshort period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level(of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said.    The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices ofsuch key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on WestGerman inflation down year.    Although there have recently been signs of inflationpicking up, he said that this was due to changes in keycommodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year wouldbe unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.    Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growthwas longer term, in that the economy was building up thepotential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.    The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness oftargets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at themid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.    But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go awayfrom it.""";gnp
"FALL IN CANADIAN BUDGET DEFICIT TO SLOW    OTTAWA, June 18 - Finance Minister Michael Wilson said taxreform will not affect his determination to reign inexpenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the declinein the budget deficit in the late 1980s.    ""Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,""Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.    Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrsin the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as heforecast in the February budget.    And in the year ended this past March, the deficit wasexpected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.    Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal yearhigher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm incomesupport programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipatedrevenues.    But finance department documents show the pace of deficitreduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and thetransition to the reformed taxation system.    The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs infiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1billion dlrs in 1991.    Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadianeconomy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pctthis year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by anactual 3.1 pct.    Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to stabilize at aroundthe current four pct level over the next two years.";gnp
"CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>    MANILA, June 2 - The Philippines' first quarter growthfigures released yesterday indicated the government was likelyto achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor JoseFernandez said in an interview.    The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pctand gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarterfrom a year earlier.    ""I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it(growth) short,"" Fernandez said.     NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in thefourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNPgrowth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.    ""Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resourcesand if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume thatdomestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated andwould not be a stumbling block,"" Fernandez said.    ""I think even before the figures came out, simply looking atkey indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,showed that the economy was on a different track from lastyear,"" he said.    Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in thefirst and second quarters because of the dry weather, and itcould drop off in the third quarter.    He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in themanufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.    ""That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,"" he said.    He said the government had met all monetary targets set forthe first quarter in consultation with the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourthtranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.    The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July orAugust to review performance in the January-June period.    He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billiondlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find theirnet repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.    ""It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA(official development assistance) accounts the commercialbanking system will be requested to hold the line,"" he said.    It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMFdebt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.    The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.    Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos inApril 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started inOctober last year, had almost been completed.    He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding leveltouched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.""Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,"" he said.    Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, ""Ithink the Philippine debt stock looms large because our ownreceipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leapforward as might have been suitable.""    The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.    NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the firstquarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.    Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth ofbetween six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that whilegrowth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.    Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by someeconomists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to thedollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports morecompetitive.    ""By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the pesohas already substantially devalued against all of the country'strading partners,"" he said.    On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he wasopposed to a clause which would allow the unrestrictedrepatriation abroad of investments made during the first twoyears after the imposition of the Code.    The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, hasbeen delayed by objections from some business groups.    ""I think any central bank, certainly this one after theevents of the past two or two and a half years, has to beprudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the windsand I'm not about to do that,"" Fernandez said.    ""It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement ofcapital and earnings can be free,"" he said.    ""We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainlywe continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our externalavailabilities simply by servicing our debts.""";gnp
JAPAN PANEL URGES WORLD ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENTS    TOKYO, June 19 - Japan could avoid a sharp rise in thevalue of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. Andother nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, anadvisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency(EPA) said.    The advisory body said in its report that the yen wouldsoar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a globalbasis were delayed.    An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall toslightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed torestructure their economies.    The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cutJapan's current account surplus to two pct of gross nationalproduct (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a changewould slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annuallyduring the seven-year period to 1993.    If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollarwould remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan'scurrent-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. Thisscenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.    It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economyand four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.;gnp
OECD SAYS HIGH WAGE DEALS HARMING NORDIC STATES    PARIS, June 19 - High wage settlements in Nordic countriesthreaten to cut exports and reduce the internationalcompetitiveness of their industries, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    In Denmark, the OECD said wage settlements concluded inearly 1987 were likely to contribute to a marked deteriorationin competitiveness. Sweden's competitive position was also seenat risk from accelerating wages.    The OECD predicted that domestic demand would come underpressure from tight fiscal policy in Denmark, as well asNorway, Sweden and Finland.    Overall economic growth will vary in the differentcountries between 1986 and 1988, the OECD semi-annual reportsaid.    After a strong rise of 7.8 pct in 1986, total domesticdemand in Norway was seen falling by 1.5 pct in 1987 and onepct the following year. Denmark was also expected to see aslump in domestic demand. The report said growth in GrossDomestic Product (GDP) was likely to speed up slightly inSweden and Finland in 1987 and 1988, while declining in Denmarkand Norway.    Iceland needs to try harder to implement its new economicstrategy if any more progress is to be made towards sustainedand balanced non-inflationary growth, the OECD said.;gnp
SOUTHERN EUROPE HAS STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND GROWTH    PARIS, June 19 - Strong growth in domestic demand was a keyfeature of the economies of southern European countries in1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, theOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.    In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's totaldomestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year tofive pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growthrestrained private consumption.    Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 anddomestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expectedto be halved to five pct next year.    In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,had been the driving force behind rapid growth in GrossDomestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumptionwere expected to ease during 1988 but would still remainstrong.    The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharplynext year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the EuropeanCommunity and declining competitiveness.    In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwardsfollowing an increase early this year linked with theintroduction of Value Added Tax and a surge in food prices dueto cold weather.;gnp

The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billionmarks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief fromthe tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.    However, the institutes criticised the government, not onlyfor the timing of the reform, but also because the question ofits financing had been left open.    The government has not specified how the remaining 19billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.    The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn hadcaused uncertainty among companies and households as to whatexactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged aquick decision from the government.    They also said the government should reduce taxpreferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged arestriction of state spending and called for no increase invalue-added tax.    The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasingsubsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.    They referred specifically to a doubling of specialwritedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in apackage of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described thisas an increase in subsidies.    The institutes said total subsidies, including taxpreferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risenfurther since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, itshould be possible ""despite ... Major political difficulties"" tofinance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.    The institutes said that if the government raised valueadded tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of thepositive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.    The report also noted that the government was progressingonly slowly with its plans to privatise state companies andsaid more deregulation was needed. The government had to aimfor more competition, it said.";gnp
S. AFRICAN RESERVE BANK SAYS GROWTH RATE ON TARGET    JOHANNESBURG, June 19 - South Africa recorded annualisedreal growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of thisyear and the economy should achieve the government's target ofthree pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.    The South African central bank said in its quarterlybulletin that confidence in the economy improved from Januaryto May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in thenation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvementin the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.    It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in thethird and fourth quarters of last year.    It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreementreached with international creditors in March as evidence ofimproved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.    The accord effectively extends a moratorium on mostrepayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short termforeign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.    South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualisedsurplus on the current account of the balance of payments of7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplusof 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninthconsecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.;gnp
AUSTRALIA SET TO GROW, BUT UNEMPLOYMENT MAY RISE    PARIS, June 19 - Australia's economy should manage modestgrowth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown butunemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation forEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.    The organisation's latest half-yearly report says GrossDomestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pctin 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will behelped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demandfollowing tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.    The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumerprices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.    The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightlyand could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.    While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growthforecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.    The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economicgrowth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which isstruggling to recover from a major economic crisis.    The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year,should again show growth over the next two years, rising by0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988.;gnp
ITALIAN GDP ROSE 2.4 PCT IN 1986 FOURTH QUARTER    ROME, April 13 - Italy's Gross Domestic Product, calculatedat 1980 prices, rose 2.4 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986,compared with the same period in 1985, National StatisticsInstitute ISTAT said.

"JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD    PARIS, June 18 - Japan's trade surplus is likely tocontinue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroadincrease while domestic demand remains sluggish, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)said.    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, theOECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus lastyear, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 whileexport markets rose by only two pct.    But it said this differential between the growth ofdomestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over twopct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pctin 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 willrise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billionyen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demandand increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said themeasures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quitepossibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects haveworked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.    The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current accountsurpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantialnet external asset position could well lead to upward pressureon the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then leadmanufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thusweaken domestic growth.    The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely togorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pctgrowth. But it said Japan would continue its good performanceon inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.";gnp
GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE    ANTWERP, June 18 - The rate of increase in world palm oiluse is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said.    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said.    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm.    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season.    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said.    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth.    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.;sun-oil

YUGOSLAV ECONOMY WORSENED IN 1986, BANK DATA SHOWS    BELGRADE, April 13 - National Bank economic data for 1986shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation raterose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded andthe value of the dinar fell.    The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pcthigher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first threemonths of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hardcurrency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.    Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures indinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollarsbased on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.    Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with theconvertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to adeterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currencyarea rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.    Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 whileindustrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's datashowed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.    Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wageswere too high given the level of productivity.    Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of thelast quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.    Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 moneysupply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9billion dinars.

U.K. PRODUCER PRICES SEEN MOVED BY TECHNICALITIES    LONDON, April 13 - U.K. Producer price data for March wereroughly as expected after taking into account technical factorswhich affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analystssaid.    The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonallyadjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged fromFebruary and close to the average for the last six months.    The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pctin February.    But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips andDrew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected arise in excise duties which affected the index in March lastyear.    He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much intothe monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in Aprilwould take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.    Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' inputprices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factorssuch as a fall in industrial electricity costs.    Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures wereslightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterlinghad not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.    Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep inputcosts down over the next few months, although Tinker added thatlast year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of theyear-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return torises in the index rather than falls.;wpi

The index for input prices, also not seasonally adjusted,was set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6.    The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and Marchwas mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricitycosts and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, theDepartment said.

"TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS    TAIPEI, April 11 - Taiwan announced plans for another roundof import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before tradetalks with Washington which officials described as a move tohelp balance trade with the United States.    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry'sCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list ofproducts included 60 items asked by Washington.    ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourageimports from our trading partners, particularly from the UnitedStates,"" he said.    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinetthat the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cutby between five and 50 pct.    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added.    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island'slargest trading partner.    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts andpressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge tradedeficit with Taipei.    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. Itwidened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.

The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters lastnight he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he wouldface tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionistsentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surpluswith Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.    Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.

"CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY<AUTHOR>    By Russell Blinch, Reuters</AUTHOR>    OTTAWA, April 9 - Canada's trade picture has brightenedconsiderably, underscoring economists' predictions the sectorwould post a long awaited recovery this year.    The federal government reported today that the monthlysurplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher thanFebruary 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.    ""Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,"" said RichardsonGreenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.    Economists generally don't expect such large gains over thenext months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout theyear.    ""We thought the trade balance would improve ... over theyear, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure isindicative of that,"" commented economist James Donegan at theToronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.    Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billiondls in the month.    ""Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value ofexports up by 5.9 pct in February,"" the agency said in itsmonthly report.    Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billiondlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.    Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would endup three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billiondlrs.    Money market analysts said the positive trade news touchedoff a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning afterclosing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.    The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in earlyafternoon trading.    Economists have been banking on an improved tradeperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggishCanadian economy.

The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in earlyafternoon trading.    Economists have been banking on an improved tradeperformance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggishCanadian economy.    They say the country's consumers, who have been spending ata torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlaysthis year and this should help curtail the flow of imports intothe country.    Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the UnitedStates, by far the country's largest market, is expected to bestrong as a result of a projected rise in American consumerspending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.    ""We maintain what's going to drive Canada's exportperformance is income growth in the U.S.,"" said Midland'sDonegan.    But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economistWarren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook andsaid it could be a mistake to read too much into February'strade upturn.

"U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan</AUTHOR>    LONDON, Oct 20 - The United States is prepared to ""pull outall the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassadorto GATT Michael Samuels said.    Those rights are now being challenged by the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told aconference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate ifthe EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef withoutthe issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effecton January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meatshipments into the EC.    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseedprices over the current market level and which may be extendedto include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral tradenegotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to beerected,"" Samuels said.    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farmsubsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it isunrealistic.    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposalon farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formallynext week.    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reducetensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cerealssubstitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction offarm subsidies.    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long asthey are directly linked to long-term commitments to end majortrade distortions, Samuels said.    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formallysubmitted and respond to it officially then.    ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Estedeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""the U.S. Ambassador said.    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignoresthe U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.    The key difference between the two approaches is that theU.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushingonly for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,there would be little incentive for the Community to work tocorrect the international trade situation, he added.    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the ECoilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports tothird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which theU.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.";trade
"YEUTTER SAYS JAPANESE CURB ALL BUT CERTAIN    WASHINGTON, April 17 - U.S. Trade Representative ClaytonYeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would goahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.    Asked in a television interview what the chance was forReagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japaneseelectronic exports, he said ""slim to none.""    Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs toretaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to enddumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less thancost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.    Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United Statesdid not want to terminate the agreement and would dropthe tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.    He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officialsthey were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would taketime to monitor any compliance.    Asked how long that would take, he said ""We want to see apattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that wouldtake a few weeks.""    Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumerimpact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goodsbecause the items selected are also readily available fromother countries and manufacturers.    He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.    ""It seems to me it is not in the interests of either countryto get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand thatfull well,"" Yeutter said.    He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but ""that's more of apaper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see anyadverse impact on U.S. trade.""    Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductorissue could be resolved before or during a Washington visitlater this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.    He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as amajor issue, would be productive but ""I don't see any practicalway to resolve this particular dispute before or during hisvisit.""";trade

TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>    BRUSSELS, April 13 - Member states of the EuropeanCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan whichthey believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to openits market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ECcountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with thewillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanesegovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, asEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction toan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC couldraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligationsentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designedto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that ofthe U.S.    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC'strade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February.    In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billiondlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell onepct to 12.43 billion dlrs.    In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France hasdecided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.    Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozenCoquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict applicationof French quality standards -- something EC states say oftenhappens to their own exports entering Japan.    Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanesebanks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out incompetition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.    However, British officials in London have said that thegovernment may have gone too far in implying that it would takeimmediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.    By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successfuleconomy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferringto rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its ownindustries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.    The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recentyears, substituting general calls for action by Japan to openits market with specific demands for moves in key areas.    At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to endallegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines andspirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contractsfor the building of a new international airport, and tosimplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.    EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, butoften the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariffbarriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.    They stress, however, that any action must be taken by theEC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.    One of the problems Britain could face if it were towithdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankerswould be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,they point out.;trade

"ISRAEL MINISTER SEES INCREASED EXPORTS TO U.S.    NEW YORK, June 29 - Israel's exports to the U.S. can andmust double over the next five years if the mideast nation'sgoal of economic independence is to be achieved, said GadYaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.    Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerceseminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's totalexports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billiondlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.    ""I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reachfive billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn tofunction in the American marketplace and place greater emphasison product quality,"" Yaacobi said.    While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis Europeancurrencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,""Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trendtoward higher U.S. exports.    In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rosefivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, whileimports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.    Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pctannually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.     He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passedlast year and eliminating all duties and other commercialrestrictions between the two nations through 1994, wouldcontinue to facilitate the desired export growth.    Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act asan economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentageof the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.    Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middleeast was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been ableto achieve its economic potential.    Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs inaid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financingmilitary conflicts ""which were imposed on Israel,"" he said.    Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economicindependence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption thatexports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.";trade

Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with theconvertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to adeterioration in trade.

"JAPANESE TARIFFS SEEN AS WORLDWIDE WARNING<AUTHOR>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - The tough trade sanctions PresidentReagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot acrossJapan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair tradepractices worldwide, U.S. officials said.    But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at BrookingsInstitution, a think tank, said ""a shot across their bow canoften result in a shot in our stern.""    He said it left the United States open to retaliation.    The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan orderedon 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congressthat a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,and no new protectionist legislation is needed.    In the past year tough trade action had been taken againstthe European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beerand wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters thetariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a ""serious signal""to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.    Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honoran agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets atless than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. Thetariffs were placed on items which were available from othersources so there would be little effect on the Americanconsumer, Fitzwater said.    Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action- especially against Japan - to end global unfair tradepractices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.    The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.    The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billiondlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for aboutone-third of America's overall deficit.    But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, WestGermany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said thepresident is ready to fight them all.    Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regretthat these actions are necessary,"" but that the health andvitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential toAmerican competitiveness in world markets.    ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair tradingpractices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his Californiavacation home at Santa Barbara.    He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japanabided by the agreement.    U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that healready has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.    The White House aide said of the tariff action, ""it wasn'tdone to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair tradepractice.""    The aide added, however, ""on another plane, it was anexample of how the administration uses the trade law to fightunfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a majoroverall of our trade laws.""    But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was notin the best interests of the United States, and thatnegotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.    ""It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,"" hesaid, ""because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions intrade.""    Crandall said, ""the administration is doing this for itspolitical impact across the country, and therefore its impacton Congress.""    He said, ""I don't think it makes a lot of sense.""    But other analysts said it made little difference whetherthe tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,and that the main point was that the trading partners were onnotice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.    Spokesman Fitzwater said ""we don't want a trade war,"" but theimposition of sanctions showed the United States would act whenit had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES    MADRID, April 9 - The head of Spain's employers'federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worriedabout the government's monetary policies because high realinterest rates were hampering investment.    He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far thisyear were not endangering the government's five pct inflationtarget. The government's perceived need to control inflation bykeeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.    High real interest rates were attracting an influx ofspeculative foreign capital which was undercutting thegovernment's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.    Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and atarget range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.    To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call moneyrate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from11.8 at end-1986.    Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call tohold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and newwage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.    These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanishworkers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.    He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected thestate sector, where the government is trying to impose its fivepct wage ceiling.    Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend inSpain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the firsttwo months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pctincrease over the corresponding period last year.    However, employers did not favour a devaluation of thepeseta to correct the imbalance.;trade
JAPAN DETAILS PLAN TO STAVE OFF TRADE PROBLEMS     TOKYO, April 17 - Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and anincrease in government purchases of foreign goods, the head ofthe committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.    The plan will also urge the government to double 1985'sofficial development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within fiveyears instead of seven as the government had promised, seniorLDP officials said at a press conference.    LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explainthe plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.    Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister YasuhiroNakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.    Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of thetax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abewill be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.    The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods bythe government will probably include the purchase of supercomputers, LDP officials said.    According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solvespecific trade problems with other nations and will encourageflows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.    The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy andlessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.    The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to andwelcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrialnations in Washington last week, they said.    The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of severalpackages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will beunveiled by the government in late May.;trade
U.S. WEIGHS LIFTING JAPANESE TRADE CURBS    WASHINGTON, June 2 - The White House has completed a newreview of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has notyet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan lastApril should be lifted, U.S. officials said.    They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked atJapan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pactyesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.    But there was no hint what the announcement might be.    Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to behonoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.    But they also noted that the White House has said it wasunlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of theworld's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.    The officials added that while the curbs complicatedU.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was nottaking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.    Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation forJapan's failure to honor commitments to end dumpingsemiconductors in world markets at less than production costsand to open its own market to U.S. goods.    The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese televisionsets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.    Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted assoon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adheringto the pact.;trade
U.S. MAY END ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - The United States may lift anadditional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan laterthis month, Reagan Administration officials said.    President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions onJapanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and thirdcountry markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.    The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct onJapanese color television sets, hand-held power tools andportable computers.    Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  afterJapan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market atbelow production costs.    Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memoryand recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.    The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of thesemiconductors in third countries, where they had been takingsales away from American-made semiconductors.    They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions wouldbe lifted by the end of the month.    The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening theclosed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.    U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliancewith the agreement earlier this week.    The periodic reviews are to continue and the remainingsanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan isin full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.;trade

Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrsat end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.

"EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CRITICISES U.S TRADE MEASURES    GENEVA, June 18 - The European Community (EC) accused theUnited States of violating a political commitment to free tradethrough practices including a tax on imported gasoline and acustoms user fee.    EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to thesurveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.    Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States incriticising Brazil for extending its list of products for whichimport licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as toimprove its balance of payments.    The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rulesby restricting imports of agricultural products through animport licensing system. The United States asked forconsultations with Tokyo on the issue.    Tran charged that the trade measures contravened apolitical commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.    When ministers established the four year Uruguay round tonegotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATTsurveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATTjargon as ""standstill and rollback.""    Tran criticised Washington for the ""superfund"" tax on oilimports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a specialmachine tool (known as category FSC34) from its governmentprocurement list for reasons of national security.    Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended thepolicies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.    The surveillance body will send a record of today's talksto the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,to decide any further action on the charges.    The oil tax and customs user fee have already been thesubject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside theUruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.    The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel'sreport and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil importsbreached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify itslegislation.

But in an interview with Reuters during the flight toTokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw aninternational spotlight on Japan's agricultural importprotection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to openits markets.    ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, butthey are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said.    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessionsduring Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessionswould be unveiled later this month, they said.    ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (PrimeMinister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when hevisits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports bypartially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last weekrequesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial usessuch as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, sayingTokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota forbeef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers wouldlike to buy much more beef than currently allowed.    He cited the example of a California company whichtransports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter tocircumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher thanthe value of the animal, he said.    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry PromotionCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrowfrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japanhas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan toeliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice byApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventuallybe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges becauseliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanesemandarin orange industry.    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate becauseimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. AndJapanese officials have said.   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buysurplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.

"CURRENCY MOVES MAY BE HURTING WORLD TRADE<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 13 - Japanese trade figures are seriouslychallenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Groupof Seven industrialised nations that relative currency ratesare the key to smoothing world trade problems.    Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo saythey are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currenciesare the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japanshrinking?    What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar downmade world trade problems worse rather than solving them,fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast ofworld trade recession?    U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollarfall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Fivepact in New York.    The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pctmore competitive in Japan. The officials, most of themeconomists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.    Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan risingrapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declinedonly 11 pct against the yen.?    Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widelyinterpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollarmust go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?    At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials canonly offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.    ""I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,"" said HughRichardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.    ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making ahell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, thereis money to be made in Japan,"" he added.    But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive tradepractices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such asagriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonablechecking and customs procedures for car imports.    Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in theface of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, theyblame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.    ""We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,""said a senior official, who declined to be named. ""We like torefrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.""    Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of theKeidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Moritarepeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort tounderstand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree.

The department is required by law to wait 48 hours afterthe initial trade report to issue a second report on a ""customsvalue"" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurancecharges from the cost of imports.    Private-sector economists emphasized that the CommerceDepartment was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billiondlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.    A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in theforeign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealerssaid, that the underlying trade deficit for February had beenrevised downward.    The Commerce department would like to have the law changedto permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.    ""My feeling is the second one is a better report but there'slegislation that requires us to delay it two days,"" said RobertOrtner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.    ""But this has been going on for a long time and no one paysany attention to the second figure.""

Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includescustoms, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparisonwith other countries that reported their trade balances on thesame basis.

"U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT    WASHINGTON, June 18 - U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen ifthe two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policyresearch groups.    The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Instituteof Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on crossborder trade would benefit both countries.    But Cato chairman William Niskanen added ""the two nations'generally harmonious trade relations are probably notsustainable without a new agreement.""    The United States and Canada, whose cross-border tradetotaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holdingtalks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriersremaining between their two countries.    The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but bothsides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargainingremained.    Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade tiescould deteriorate because of Congressional pressure onPresident Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, andthis could hit some Canadian trade practices.    He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its autoindustry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateralfree trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.    Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable toa resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.exports to Canada.    A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and PrimeMinister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada andenable its industries to achieve economies of scale, whichwould also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.    It would also increase the gross national products of bothcountries.    Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end alltariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rulesfor trade in services and investments, end curbs on governmentprocurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.";trade

"REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS<AUTHOR>    By Robert Trautman, Reuters</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, April 17 - President Reagan today is toannounce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports toretaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfairpractices in semiconductor trade.    The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs ofJapanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel ofexperts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.    Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffson certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computorsand television sets to power tools and photographic film.    The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to SantaBarbara, where Reagan is vacationing.    In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed tofull enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provideAmerican industry with free and fair trade opportunities.""    He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored thepact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in worldmarkets and opened its home market to U.S. products.    U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the Marchannouncement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""wedo not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind ofaction that requires meaningful action.""    Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.    About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.    Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president toretaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.    He has opposed the legislation, saying it would preventnegotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, thatexisting law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.    Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese wasas much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did notneed any new trade legislation.    The Japanese have complained that they have been honoringthe semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before theresults showed up.    U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring ofJapanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries andWestern Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that theJapanese home markets remained shut to American exports.    Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it wouldfile a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade(GATT).    It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation hadviolated the regulations of the global trading group and wouldapprove compensation or Japanese retaliation.    U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan wouldretaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war withthe United States.";trade

The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of ECstates after West Germany withdrew objections to increasedquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,saying that the main dispute was over sales of cerealssubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, theofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade).    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership.

The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are inretaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement toend dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost andto open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.

Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was littlelikelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pctduties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.    President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials thatJapan was not honoring the agreement.    In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed tothe full enforcement of our trade agreements designed toprovide American industry with free and fair trade.""

"PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS    ISLAMABAD, June 29 - Pakistani government allowed freercotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimedat narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.    Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in atelevised speech the government had also decided to allowduty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industrymore competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export ofPakistani products.       Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which havebeen handled exclusively by state corporations since early1970s.    But Haq said now the private sector would also exportcotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets along-standing demand of the local traders.    The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed tobring down prices and help the local ancillary industriescompete effectively in the world market, he said.       Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years butreviewed every year.    It was a departure from the previous practice of announcingtrade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it wouldenable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over alonger period.    He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been providedfor the export of engineering goods to selected third worldcountries on soft credit terms.       Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 percent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.

Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israelipacts ""other countries have realized that if they want tocontinue to have access to the world's largest market, they hadbetter get serious about improving the GATT.""    The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasingshipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantiallyincrease the gross national products in both countries.    Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts shouldserve as important precedents for progress in GATT.    Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys toenhanced political and economic stability around the globe.""    He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not onlyfor advanced industrial nations, but also for other countriesthat need to increase trade in order to better their standardsof living.""    Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progressmade in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting toprotectionism.    He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congressthat would force the United States to take retaliatory actionsagainst nations with large trade surpluses with the UnitedStates if the countries practiced unfair trade.    The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. tradedeficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is stillrising.    Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard toresist, but the pending legislation would undermine PresidentReagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.    Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.    He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that containsserious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.""";trade
"JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 8 - Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market,"" he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the officialsaid.";trade
"U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE    WASHINGTON, June 1 - The use of tariffs and quotas toreduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will dolittle to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a governmentstudy said.    In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products lesscompetitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost ofimported products that are re-exported in different forms.    ""Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather thanhelp, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,"" it said.    The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilkeand Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, whichclimbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shiftingcurrency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.    Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such asforeign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrialcompetitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictionson mergers, added little to the problem, it said.    ""Although each industry's competitiveness affects the levelof imports and exports in that industry, in general we findthat there have been no significant industry-specific changesaffecting competitiveness that would explain the increase inthe overall trade deficit,"" the study said.    ""To the extent any government action is needed to deal withthe trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-widephenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,""the FTC study said.    Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shiftswere the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the reportsaid it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost somedomestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.    It also said it found a ""fairly direct relationship"" betweenthe increased trade deficit and the influence of shiftingcurrency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domesticdemand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreignconsumer demand.    The study examined seven factors which have been commonlyblamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies andtrade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack ofinvestment in U.S. Industry, declining research and developmentin U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oilprices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.    In each case, the study found little or no evidence thatthe factor had any impact on the trade deficit.";trade

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 9 - Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts andTelecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international forceto be reckoned with, political analysts said.    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control ofa lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,they said.    ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control ofa key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""said one diplomatic source.    ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic sourcesaid.    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does notalways help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analystssaid.    ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were notso internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor MitsuruUchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the worldcommunity and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how toface the situation.""    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row withLondon over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keepa major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete inJapan's lucrative overseas telephone business.    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rivalgroups, arguing the market cannot support more than onecompetitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which nowmonopolizes the business.    It has also opposed a major management role in the plannedmerger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm onthe grounds that no such international precedent exists.    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which hasthreatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the mergerplan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to openits telecommunications market.    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which itsays have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's cartelephone and satellite communications market.    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of thesector it regulates.    ""What has been happening is an important shift in theeconomy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" saidJames Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia AdvisoryService Inc.    A decision to open the telecommunications industry tocompetition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boostedrather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.    ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de factolegal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst DarrellWhitten.    Close links with the powerful political faction of theruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former PrimeMinister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, theanalysts said.    ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanakafaction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importanceof MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members ofthe influential political group, he added.    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due tothe more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in thePostal Savings System, analysts said.    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulateinterest rates on small deposits, a key element in financialliberalisation, since the change would remove the PostalSavings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates thanbanks, they said.    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT'sobstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterizedthe ministry as feudal.    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limitingcompetition and sheltering the former monopolies under itswing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowestprice takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those ofits bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western worldincluding Britain, several analysts said.    ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep orderin utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonableview,"" he said.";trade

TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN    BRUSSELS, April 13 - Member states of the EuropeanCommunity are starting to run out of patience with Japan whichthey believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to openits market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ECcountries bear witness to a new disillusionment with thewillingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanesegovernment to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, asEC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.   Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction toan EC executive commission proposal under which the EC couldraise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligationsentered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designedto stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that ofthe U.S.    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC'strade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs inMarch, up from 1.94 billion in February.;trade
"TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS    TAIPEI, April 11 - Taiwan announced plans for another roundof import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before tradetalks with Washington which officials described as a move tohelp balance trade with the United States.    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry'sCustoms Administration Department, told reporters the list ofproducts included 60 items asked by Washington.    ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourageimports from our trading partners, particularly from the UnitedStates,"" he said.    He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinetthat the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cutby between five and 50 pct.    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursdayand the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly startingon April 20, he added.    Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce itsgrowing trade surplus with the United States, the island'slargest trading partner.    Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts andpressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge tradedeficit with Taipei.    Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985.

By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3removes protection for companies that take advantage of widelyused government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.    ""Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grantrights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could bevulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,"" hesaid.    The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the Houseof Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuringsubsidies that would greatly increase the size of anycountervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadianresource exports to the U.S.    Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices andU.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, hesaid. Such a method would make Canadian resource industriesvulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export taximposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumberto the U.S., Zimmerman added.

"DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT<AUTHOR>    By Irwin Arieff</AUTHOR>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - Financial analysts say they arepleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federalbudget deficit but believe the actions will do little to helpimprove the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.    The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrowto approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the comingfiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.    Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a planthat would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs nextyear.        ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs isinfinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have littleimpact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said StanleyCollander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.    ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collandersaid in an interview.    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedlytold Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long wayto help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help easesome of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.    The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the tradeimbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volckerhas warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraughtwith danger.    Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation asimported goods become more expensive and chase away foreigncapital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.    In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with othermajor industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value ofthe dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange ratesshould be stabilized at around current levels.    As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed totake steps to stimulate their economies and the United Statesagreed to cut its budget deficit.    The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as away to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, isto reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.    ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything elseyou do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recenttestimony before the Senate Banking Committee.    Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten thegovernment's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the creditsupply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures orto assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the UnitedStates.    Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off thecurrent modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.    Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressedthat any deficit reduction was better than none.    But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility itneeds to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollarfrom plunging further in world exchange markets.    ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but ifyour objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve theFed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answeris, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters.    The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government'smost vexing and persistent problems.    The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yetlittle indication that this year's figure will be any lower,though administration officials have predicted it will drop byabout 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.    In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleepworrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from thefederal budget.    On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is notattached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set forthe 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balancedbudget law.    While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs fornext year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate BudgetCommittees have conceded that their budget plans would fallshort of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.    ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about themost you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time,said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than thatwould be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.""    Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end upshort of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.    ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptablereduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will nowlook like a failure to Wall Street.""    The budget plan now under debate on the House floor wouldlower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the yearbeginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cuttingdefense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from theiranticipated spending levels for next year.    The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit ofnearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.";trade

Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of thetax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abewill be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.    The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods bythe government will probably include the purchase of supercomputers, LDP officials said.specific trade problems with other nations and will encourageflows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.    The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy andlessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.

"U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND<AUTHOR>    BY HISANOBU OHSE, REUTERS</AUTHOR>    NEW YORK, June 1 - The dollar's recent signs of stabilityhave raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves untilafter the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.    ""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if thedollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.    Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its valueagainst the yen and the mark as part of an officiallyorchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive onworld markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.    On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yenbut has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.    Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen farenough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.    The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in Marchfrom 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continuedimprovement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.    Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that iffurther progress is reported, the dollar would head back uptowards 150 yen.    ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomedout for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First NationalBank of Chicago.    Other factors supporting this bullish view were growingexpectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker wouldbe reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan'slarger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.    The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampenspeculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active centralbank intervention to support the dollar.    The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week thatthe U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billiondlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amountsince the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.    Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's interventionvolume as ""impressive"".    James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the tradedata are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and140 yen.""    Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New Yorkwarned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.""    Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okadasaid market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline ofthe U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.    Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reactionto the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,which is likely to focus on the implementation of previouscommitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.    President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisionsmade last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group ofSeven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot beignored or forgotten.""    ""The commitments made at these meetings need to betranslated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.    Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear thebrunt of U.S. calls for further action.    Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up onGermany to take stimulative action like Japan.""    Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollarcould hold above 145 yen for some months it could also comeunder attack again if it seems the latest economic package isnot having much impact on Japan's economy and its tradesurplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trustbanks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollarpositons hedged against exchange losses in their foreignportfolios, while some others have started covering those shortpositions, Japanese bank dealers said.";trade
U.S. URGES JAPAN TO OPEN FARM MARKET FURTHER    TOKYO, April 17 - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lynghas asked Japan to open its farm market further to helpWashington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionistpressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.    Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's EconomicAffairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture MinisterMutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would helpJapan as well as the United States.    The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan byLyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.    However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan wasalready the world's largest grain importer.    Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain anddepended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its foodrequirements in 1985.    Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farmproducts named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as onbeef, citrus products and rice.    Kato said Japan will maintain its current level ofself-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus ricebecause potential production is higher than domestic demand.    The world farm market suffers from surpluses because ofrising production by exporting countries, he added.    Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm productoutput with expensive programs, Maki said.

"SOUTH KOREA MOVES TO SLOW GROWTH OF TRADE SURPLUS<AUTHOR>    By Moon Ihlwan, Reuters</AUTHOR>    SEOUL, April 8 - South Korea's trade surplus is growing toofast and the government has started taking steps to slow itdown, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.    He told a press conference the government planned toincrease investment, speed up the opening of the local marketto foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to holdthe surplus ""at a proper level.""    But he said the government would not allow the won toappreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea hasbeen under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.    The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus withthe U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3billion dlrs in 1985.    Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospectswere bright for the South Korean economy, but the governmentwould try to hold the current account surplus to around fivebillion dlrs a year for the next five years.    ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, fivebillion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth inexports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But nowthe surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said.    Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of thisyear, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.    Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to asurplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlrdeficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled thecountry to reduce its foreign debt last year for the firsttime.    South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrsin 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largestin Asia.    ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of themajor constraints on our development... Last year was a majorturning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said.    Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio offoreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, fromabout 50 pct in 1986.    ""The government, however, does not want to acceleratereducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" hesaid.    Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflationand lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,particularly the United States.    ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, butwe are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at aproper level,"" Kim said.";trade
"JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD    PARIS, June 18 - Japan's trade surplus is likely tocontinue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroadincrease while domestic demand remains sluggish, theOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)said.    In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, theOECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus lastyear, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 whileexport markets rose by only two pct.    But it said this differential between the growth ofdomestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""    It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over twopct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pctin 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 willrise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.    The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billionyen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demandand increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said themeasures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quitepossibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects haveworked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.    The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current accountsurpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantialnet external asset position could well lead to upward pressureon the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then leadmanufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thusweaken domestic growth.    The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely togorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pctgrowth. But it said Japan would continue its good performanceon inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.";trade

"ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT<AUTHOR>    By William Kazer, Reuters</AUTHOR>    HONG KONG, April 8 - Mounting trade friction between theU.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exportingnations that the row could inflict far-reaching economicdamage, businessmen and officials said.    They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in theU.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.    But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurtthem in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might betheir gain.    The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs onimports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, inretaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact notto sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.    Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffsat 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firmssaid they would virtually halt exports of products hit by thenew taxes.    ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman forleading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co Ltd <MC.T>.    ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of timebeyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion ofexports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said TomMurtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker <JamesCapel and Co>.    In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.    ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat againstJapan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a seniorTaiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.    Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs lastyear, 95 pct of it with the U.S.    The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reservesto 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.    ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers andcut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if wewant to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" saidPaul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters <Taiwan Safe Group>.    A senior official of South Korea's trade promotionassociation said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japanmight also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exportsare similar to those of Japan.    Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billiondlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.    In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said toughcurbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers ofsemiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to theU.S.    In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has beenselling below-cost semiconductors, some electronicsmanufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said sucha short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed byfurther U.S. Pressure to block imports.    ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills,director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.    ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it willbe extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kongis the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said.    The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.    The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of tradetalks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.

"INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY    WASHINGTON, June 2 - With more private investment, not moreprotection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitivewith the most modern foreign producers, analysts from twocongressional agencies said today.    The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm ofCongress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearingthere was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason foroptimism than a few years ago.    ""While textile producers are making significantinvestments, they could do more,"" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.    The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisanbudget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loanguarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather thanincreased trade protection which could lead to foreignretaliation.    CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit forprofits and investments of domestic firms.    Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said theagencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion againstcongressional approval of protectionist textile quotalegislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and otherAsian textile producing countries.    President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection billbut it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and isexpected to be voted on in the House this year.    However, approval this year is in doubt because passage ofa major trade bill without specific protections for textilesshowed a weakening of support for the legislation.    Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreignproducers in the use of modern textile and apparel productionequipment and net imports are growing faster than the domesticmarkets, Kelly said.    He added that private investment in the textile andclothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-sevenththe average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.    Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports oftextiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pctwhile U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.    ""The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced bynew technology, imports, or some combination of both.

"JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS<AUTHOR>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 17 - Basic reform of Japan's protected farmsector is a key to shifting its economy away from export todomestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its tradesurplus, securities analysts said.    The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs andquotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, andsheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, theysaid.    ""In economic terms, reform would be a plus,"" said ChristopherChew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.    The ultimate cost of the existing system is food pricestwice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,The analysts said.    Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of theaverage household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the grossnational product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.    Reducing these prices could increase household spendingpower by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent onproducts which would have a more direct impact in boostingdomestic growth, it added.    ""There's a lot of slack,"" a U.S. Government official in Tokyosaid. ""All that money could be spent on something else.""    Direct central government subsidies to the farm sectoramount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independentestimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.    Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farmon weekends to put their land up for sale for residentialdevelopment would also give a boost to domestic spending,economists said.    ""Housing construction is the key strategic variable in theexpansion of domestic demand,"" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professorat Kyoto Gakuen University.    Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reformto shift some of the burden of trade friction and economicrestructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto thefarm sector. Employers groups also want change. ""If you reallywant to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not toraise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,"" BumpeiOtsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'Associations told a recent press conference.    External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seekremoval of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their tradedeficits with Japan.    But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain wellentrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.    Although the full-time farm population is falling and thereare signs the LDP is paying more attention to urbanconstituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent onfarm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth severalcity votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.    The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reformplan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,the analysts said.    Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept thetraditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay fornational food security, they said.    Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed toimport liberalisation, but are more flexible about reformsaimed at stepping up productivity, they said.    Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specificpressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.";trade
"BRITISH MINISTER SAYS HE WARNED TOKYO OF SANCTIONS    LONDON, April 11 - A British minister said he had given theJapanese government a clear warning of sanctions againstJapanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to itsinternal markets ""and it was clearly understood.""    Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on hisreturn from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese werebeginning to appreciate the need to be ""fair and open"" aboutaccess to their own markets.    At an airport news conference Howard denied oppositioncharges that his trip had been a failure because he hadreturned empty-handed.    ""I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clearmessage to the Japanese government, and I delivered it veryclearly, and it has been clearly understood.""    Howard said that under the Financial Services Act thegovenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctionsagainst Japanese companies and finance houses operating inBritain.    ""It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusingoperating licences. We can ban firms from certain countriesfrom carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowingthem to carry out other kinds.""    ""I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made itclear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall usethem.""    He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan becameinvolved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gainedmore than anyone else from an open trading relationship.

"U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan</AUTHOR>    LONDON, Oct 20 - The United States is prepared to ""pull outall the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassadorto GATT Michael Samuels said.    Those rights are now being challenged by the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told aconference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate ifthe EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef withoutthe issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effecton January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meatshipments into the EC.    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseedprices over the current market level and which may be extendedto include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral tradenegotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to beerected,"" Samuels said.    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farmsubsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it isunrealistic.    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposalon farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formallynext week.    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reducetensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cerealssubstitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction offarm subsidies.    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long asthey are directly linked to long-term commitments to end majortrade distortions, Samuels said.    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formallysubmitted and respond to it officially then.    ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Estedeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""the U.S. Ambassador said.    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignoresthe U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.    The key difference between the two approaches is that theU.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushingonly for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,there would be little incentive for the Community to work tocorrect the international trade situation, he added.    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the ECoilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports tothird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which theU.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.";sugar

UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET    LONDON, Oct 19 - British Sugar Plc was forced to shut itsIpswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acuteshortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to aReuter inquiry    Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combinationof very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in thefactory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week'shurricane which blocked roads.    The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads arecleared and supplies of beet build up again.    This is the first time in many years that a factory hasbeen closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.    Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.    Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by BritishSugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a yearout of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.    Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvestingproblems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintainingits estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, thespokesman said.    British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.    The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,is expected to run until the end of January.

"SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM    PORT-AU-PRINCE, April 11 - A sugar mill which was thisnation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled fromMiami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.    The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,the company said.    ""Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCOregrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar caneafter April 10,"" the mill warned planters earlier this week.    Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteenmonths ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cookingoil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumerprices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwinghundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.

""We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.We have no money left to continue operations,"" Rigaud said.    He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed anadditional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.    Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvaliertwo years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.    He said the government then began importing refined sugarat world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit andthe provisional military-civilian government that replacedDuvalier last year continued the policy.

The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced486,790 tonnes.

Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would makea payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment forthe 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growersfor commencement of harvesting would be completed at all millsby June 23.    Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.    The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is thefull amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceedsreceived to-date. The balance will be paid in October.    Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery tothe mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlledFiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.    However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of theforecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all caneharvested by November 30, he said.

EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY    BRUSSELS, April 9 - The maximum export rebate granted atyesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy overproducer complaints that they are not obtaining the ECintervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, ECCommission sources said.    The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previousweek, but the change is explained by world market conditions.    Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed toobtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over oneEcu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,the sources said.    They said this was despite the fact that the Commission hadto accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention fromoperators protesting that rebates are too low.    Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unlessthe Commission reviews its export policy, they said.;sugar

U.S. CONGRESSMAN INTRODUCES REAGAN SUGAR BILL    WASHINGTON, April 9 - Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., introducedin the House of Representatives legislation proposed by theReagan administration to slash the U.S. sugar price support, aspokesman for Porter said.    The spokesman said the bill was introduced without anychanges from the administration's proposal sent to Congresslast month.    That plan calls for a cut in the sugar loan rate to 12cents per pound from 18 cents now. Sugar growers would becompensated for the price cut with targeted direct payments,to be gradually phased-out through 1990. The payments togrowers would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs.    Representatives of sugar growers have rejected theproposal, saying it would ruin the domestic sugar industry.;sugar
RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP    SYDNEY, April 8 - Good rains of one to four inches in thepast 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops inthe Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, anAustralian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.    As previously reported, the region has been undergoing asevere dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, sinceDecember, following the virtual failure of the summer wetseason.    Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops arebeginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growthsince the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.    Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much betterthan it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesmansaid. But is too early to say what they will be and more rainis needed to restore sub-soil moisture.    Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg regionand southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition andsome mills are forecasting record crops, he said.    Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiledtowards the end of May, he said.    The cane crush normally runs from June to December.;sugar
"DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED    ROTTERDAM, April 8 - Roughly half of this year's expected130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in theNetherlands, told Reuters.    Conditions are generally good and the average sowing datefor the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesmanadded.    ""It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we canexpect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least thecrop is off to a very good start,"" he said.    Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes ofwhite sugar, substantially more than the country's combined ""A""and ""B"" quota of 872,000 tonnes.    This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has beenintroduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota ""C"" sugar produced.    Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have beenallotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area beingboosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.";sugar
COLD, WET WEATHER SLOWS BEET GROWTH IN W. EUROPE    RATZEBURG, June 19 - Cold and wet weather in northern,western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beetgrowth but plant density is reported to be good in mostcountries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.    Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain hashampered field work and occasionally led to water-loggedfields.    But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather hasboosted sugar beet growth.    Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beetdevelopment, Licht said.    In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plantpopulation is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainyweather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects arerated as slightly below normal.    In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool withheavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.    In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, itwas mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall whichcontinued to slow down beet growth and often made field workimpossible.    In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which wasfavourable for beet growth, Licht said.    In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouringbeet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.    In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,it was warm with showers over most areas and weather wasgenerally good for the emergence and growth of beets.    In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfallboosted beet development.    Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputesbetween the factories and the trade unions are threatening todelay the start of processing in the southern areas, wherebeets are maturing very early this year.;sugar
CHINA PROVINCE BECOMES GRAIN IMPORTER    PEKING, June 1 - The south China province of Guangdong isimporting millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas andother parts of China because farmers have switched from grainto more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.    The official magazine said the province's grain area fellto 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of atotal farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.    Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in partto supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, themagazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.    The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of nationalfarmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct underother crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.    It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity andlow productivity make grain the least profitable farmcommodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuanfrom cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.    It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted onlygradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system.;sugar
"CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS<AUTHOR>    By Mark O'Neill, Reuters</AUTHOR>    PEKING, June 2 - China will not increase sugar importssubstantially this year because of foreign exchange constraintsand large stocks, despite falling production and risingdomestic demand, traders and the official press said.    ""Despite rapid increases in domestic production over thelast 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue tobe extremely serious,"" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, becausefarmers could earn more from other crops and because technicaland seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.    The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop(November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a yearearlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.    The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlierfigure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New ChinaNews Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.    The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong provincefell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that thearea under sugar was dropping.    ""Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,"" the newspapersaid. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation ofnearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of caneis a major problem.""    A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop inarea planted.    He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were weldeveloped, enabling farmers to choose crops according to themaximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.    The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast provinceof Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only70 from one mu of sugarbeet.    The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.    Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competedwith each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted infalling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.    The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, theofficial press has said.    Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes ofsugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.    The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mlntonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.    A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocksin 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to importsugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986when the central government resumed control of imports.    ""As China lacked storage, much of these imports was storedin Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,"" the diplomatsaid.    The trader said transporting stocks from these areas toconsumers in east and south China was a problem, particularlyas coal had priority. ""How quickly they can move the sugar isone factor determining import levels,"" he said.    Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.    ""China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about152/153 dlrs a tonne,"" he added. ""China is not a desperate buyernow. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go intothe open market.""    A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regardingimports was price.    ""While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,foreign exchange restraints persist,"" he said.    The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about fivepct a year but ""a communist government is in a much betterposition to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if theforeign exchange situation demands it.""";sugar

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT    WASHINGTON, April 9 - Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasonsfor the decline are expected reduced government support priceand good summer crop harvests.;corn

The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier.

The duty was imposed last year after the revenuedepartment found U.S. corn production was subsidized.    It is now up to the government to decide whether to changethe duty.;corn

"ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE    LUSAKA, April 8 - The Zambian government has no immediateplans to follow last week's increase in the producer price ofmaize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, anofficial of the ruling party said.    Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price forrefined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots inwhich at least 15 people died.    That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda laterrevoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund(IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.    However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail priceincrease, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,a practice discouraged by the IMF.    ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels ofmeal. It (the government) would have to choose between thedemands of the IMF and those of the people,"" a Ministry ofAgriculture economist said.";corn

60,000 TONNES CORN SMUGGLED INTO PHILIPPINES-PAPER    MANILA, April 17 - At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the pastfew months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting anofficial in the National Food Authority (NFA).    The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortageand corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel havejeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which wasaimed at saving foreign currency.    The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan assaying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnesagainst a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.    Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of cornworth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.    The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician,as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the totalinventory at the end of the January/June crop season isexpected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.;corn

"SENATOR DEFENDS U.S. MANDATORY FARM CONTROL BILL    WASHINGTON, June 18 - Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended hiscontroversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether theyapprove of the proposal.    The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs perbushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs forsoybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls onplanted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrsfor wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.    Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world marketsharing cartel with the European Community and other exportingnations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during thefirst of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearingsexamining farm programs.    Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his""Family Farm Act.""    -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm incomeand reduce government spending on agriculture.    -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would notruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but wouldincrease overall revenue from exports.    This would be done by seeking agreement among majorexporting countries including the European Community on marketsharing at agreed high prices.    Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearingthat such a grain export cartel is not workable.    -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supportswould be passed onto consumers, but he said high food pricesstem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than fromhigh farm product prices.    Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns onequity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pctMonfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pctQuaker Oats.    -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill wouldbe the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.    He said as a transition to the higher prices, he wouldallow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.grain stocks for three years.    Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said.    -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farmparticipation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the currentfarm program. He said farmers now must participate in farmprograms in order to receive credit for planting and to protectfarm income.";corn

BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS    WASHINGTON, June 18 - U.S. House and Senate budgetnegotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reachedyesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spendingon agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.    The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.    The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from thefarm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for atotal of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.    The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculturecommittees with difficult choices on how to make changes inagriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targetswithout jeopardizing popular support payments, seniorCongressional aides told Reuters.    Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to findthe budget savings.    Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grainssubcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheatand corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrsand 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.    House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza hassaid the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.    But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely tobe approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers anda strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who saidfreezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other majorgrain export competitors and would not achieve the budgetsavings Glickman claims.    Another area where Glickman and other have said budgetsavings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,ARP, levels for wheat and corn.    However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong standwithin the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 cropwheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Mostcommodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.    Congressional sources said the only way to achievesignificant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boostthe 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source saidsingling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen asunfair to one commodity.    Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is mostlikely to eventually look for budget savings are sometightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.    Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billionbut not enough, they said.    Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculturecommittees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut onall Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including pricesupport loans and deficiency payments, similar to theGramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.    This idea has been suggested by the American Farm BureauFederation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.;corn

BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS    SAO PAULO, April 8 - Storage problems with Brazil's recordgrain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mlntonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of thisyear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable inharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storageproblems.    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,theoretically sufficient for the crop.    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badlydistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity.    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said.    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crophas been evident from television reports, which have shownenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.;corn
ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT    LUSAKA, June 1 - The Zambian government today announcedminor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its neweconomic strategy, while police and troops patrolled thenorthern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.    However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,were not affected by the cuts and many people said this couldprovoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected moresweeping reductions.    Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with thesmall extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct onitems such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.    Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone saidgovernment forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.    In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no signof troops or police reinforcements on the streets.    President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to takeaccount of lower import costs following the revaluation of thekwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.    The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economicstrategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerityprogram.    Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs ofunemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatileregion to take action against shops that did not reduce theirprices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed inthe Copperbelt during food riots last December after thegovernment tried to lift maize subsidies.;corn

FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years.;corn

"JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 8 - Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market,"" he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the officialsaid.";corn
U.S. HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO SPEED UP CORN PAYMENTS    WASHINGTON, June 2 - The House Agriculture Committee votedto make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiencypayments immediately instead of in the late fall.

The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allowso-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather thanlate this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would notbe changed.    Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spendinginto fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected tomeet stiff resistance in the full House.;corn

FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE    PARIS, June 1 - The U.S. Department of Agriculture'sforecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks willalmost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not besurprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.    The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'Association and the National Union of Agricultural and CerealCooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports orend-of-season stocks.    However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mlnwas not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.    The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecastin mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare forsoft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 andthe record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.    This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry ofAgriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectaresagainst 4.61 mln in 1986/87.    ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaignwill be released at the beginning of September, an ONICofficial said.    Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult toestimate at this stage, both within the European Community andto non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.    He said, however, that among countries to which Francecould increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghrebcountries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.    The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,was not out of line with estimates of the French MaizeProducers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.    Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields wereexpected to be higher, the AGPM official said.    It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.;corn
"GHANA LIFTS RICE/MAIZE IMPORT BAN DUE TO DROUGHT    ACCRA, June 19 - Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maizeimports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.    Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchweymade the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnesof rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aidprogramme.    The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, followsgovernment concern over ""lower than average rainfall in southernGhana and its implications for the major harvest.""    Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growingareas throughout the south this year. The Ministry ofAgriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in allmajor staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.    GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequencesof current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the droughtexperiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps toalleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.    The failure of seasonal rains has already seriouslyaffected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in partsof the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers havedried up.";corn

"RAINS HELP U.S. WESTERN CORN BELT, MORE SEEN    CHICAGO, June 29 - Weekend rain over the Western Corn Beltbrought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlierthis month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcomemoisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-WeatherInc.    ""There is going to be more rain for the next two, threedays,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal toabove normal moisture this week.""    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southernMinnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in easternNebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend butwere receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio withthudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.    ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, apretty good rain,"" Mohler said.    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparkingan early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board ofTrade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.    Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt isexpected to move over the central Midwest, then move northlater in the week. That could bring new rain patterns acrossthe Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions asearly-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stagein early July, he said.";corn

DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS    MANILA, April 11 - A prolonged dry spell has damaged111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provincesin the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officialssaid.    They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produceestimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack ofrainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailingconditions continued until next month.    Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped thelosses would be offset by the expected increase in output inother, normally more productive areas not affected by the dryspell.    Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.    About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.    Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has beenhit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national totalthus the damage is considered negligible.    In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled byproduction from non-traditional corn farms which diversifiedinto the cash crop from sugar two years ago.     The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut productionin the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were noreports of actual damage.;corn

The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market fortwo mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years.

BRAZIL SOYBEAN YIELDS SEEN AVERAGE - USDA REPORT    WASHINGTON, April 9 - Based on field travel in theBrazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be aboutaverage or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.    The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.    It said generally favorable weather from early Decemberthrough February helped compensate for earlier dryness.    However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 daysfollowed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the secondweek of march has raised concern about late planted soybeanswhich are still immature, but the impact may be localized, thereport said.    The corn crop is expected to be a record and will createserious storage problems, the report said.    Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased bymore than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields areexpected to be above average, it said.    Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn cropcrop has been harvested.    During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grainelevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, thereport said.    New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Paranaaccounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasonsfor the decline are expected reduced government support priceand good summer crop harvests.;soybean

"U.S. DRAFTS SANCTIONS IN ARGENTINA SOY CASE    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - The U.S. is drafting options includingpossible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute overthe differential between soybean and product  taxes whichBuenos Aires levies on exports.    The drafting of retaliation options follows the failureof high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filedby the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differentialexport taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports incompetition with the U.S.    ""Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict(Argentine) access to our market,"" said one U.S. source.       The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year afterTrade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed toend the differential.    But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.    Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agricultureminister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroilleon September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could notnarrow the differential further for 1987/88.    As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is consideringrestrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beefand finished leather, the U.S. sources said.    A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reaganadministration soon, they said.";soybean

"ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT        LONDON, Oct 20 - The American Soybean Association (ASA)denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegalunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, andthreatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does notremedy the situation.    ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsoredOutlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takesdrastic and immediate steps.""    ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,since they were established after the zero soybean duty wasestablished in 1962,"" he said.    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would askfor an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies tomake the regime non-discriminatory.    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, inan effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds productionhas risen dramatically since then.    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above worldmarket levels and is considering implementing a controversialoils and fats tax.    The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zeroduty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adamssaid.    The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support itstrade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes anEC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in theEC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.    U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct involume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result ofEC policies, Adams added.    Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker atthe conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.";soybean

BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS    SAO PAULO, April 8 - Storage problems with Brazil's recordgrain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mlntonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.    Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of thisyear's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.    He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable inharvesting, but that most of it would stem from storageproblems.    Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,theoretically sufficient for the crop.    But Brito said that the storage capacity was badlydistributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande doSul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but wereresponsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.    The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-Westgrowing regions, where rising production has outpaced storagecapacity.    Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya andmaize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grainsproduction but only 20 pct of its storage space.    In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared tostoring grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable forstoring loose grain, Brito said.    Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport thecrops.    The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crophas been evident from television reports, which have shownenormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.;soybean
"LYNG PLEASED EC TO OFFER GATT FARM PROPOSAL    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer aglobal farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although theUnited States opposes key parts of the proposal.    ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyngtold Reuters in an interview Tuesday.    Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourgendorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguayround agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.    Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the planseeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposingcurbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.    The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of allfarm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and haspressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reachinga global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.    However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said theReagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies isunrealistic.    Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative todoing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. Ithink that is the unrealistic position.""    ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we aretrying to say.""    Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree afreeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started.    ""All that some countries would like to have would be awheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.    The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range ofagricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, hesaid.

"SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY    CHICAGO, June 2 - Nearby months in soybean and soymealfutures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply oflivestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep thenew crop outlook bearish, traders said.    ""A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worriedabout where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,""one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.    Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers forthe few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with aDecatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bidanother two cents today to 10 over July futures.    Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willingto sell, dealers said.    Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the beliefthat even if futures rally back to last month's highs, countrymovement may remain light because farmers in many areas aresold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern halfof the Midwest.    Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtimefor maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducingthe weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping thespot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.    Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help Julysoybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal hasalready moved to a premium over the August through Octobermonths and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may alsomove to a July premium later this month, they added.";soybean
FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED<AUTHOR>    By Manuel Villanueva</AUTHOR>    BUENOS AIRES, April 8 - Argentine grain producers adjustedtheir yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain cropdownward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at theend of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.    They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimateshad been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, whichhas allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.    However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense raincould cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.    Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm inCordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 inCorrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.    There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.    Producers feared continued damp conditions could producerotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all thecrops, including soybean.    However, as the lands began drying later in the weekharvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.    Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvestedmaterial in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yieldestimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.    The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecastlast week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of4.1 mln.    Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.    Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the areasown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and willbegin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.    Production estimates for maize were down from last week at9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimatedpreviously.    This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mlntonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mlntonnes.    Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two toseven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.    Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown inCordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa andBuenos Aires in mid-April.    The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.    The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mlntonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2mln tonne crop.    The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of7.1 mln.    The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mlnto 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mlnsown in 1985/86.    The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in someareas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Someexperimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areasmaking up only about one pct of the total crop but details onthis were not available.    Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, whichwill be sown between May and August or September, has so farnot been as intense as in previous years.;soybean

MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET    KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 - Malaysia is unlikely to meet itstargeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.    Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliserand overstressed palms, they said.    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil Worldnewsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely todrop sharply this year.    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell morepalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage theindustry, a leading grower told Reuters.    The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnesagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said.    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this yeardue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expectedto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oiloutput peaks.    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new treesagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reductionwill not be felt for about another three years.;soybean
"JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 8 - Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market,"" he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the officialsaid.";soybean
"US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - A proposal to require importedtropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrowand possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopesthe plan would be adopted this year.    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as anamendment to a farm spending reduction package.    ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as givingAmerican consumers the information they need,"" he said.    Proponents of the measure, including the American SoybeanAssociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oilsare high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicatingtropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourageconsumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,Indonesia and the Philippines.    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible todefend under international trade law and would harm relationswith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of theirsaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relativelylittle from tropical oils.    The committee voted largely along party lines, with threeDemocrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.";soybean
OILMEAL DEMAND STILL STRONG IN U.S., SOVIET UNION    HAMBURG, Oct 20 - Oilmeal demand remained strong in theUnited States in July and August and six pct up on levels seenin the same months last year, with most of the rise coming insoymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said.    Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose toa record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pcton the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal atseven pct, it said.    Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago monthsfollowing a huge increase in soymeal imports.    Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediatelybut went into stocks. With imports again large in September, itestimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes byOctober 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year.    EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a yearearlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed,sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due tobumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposalswere reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mlnat that time last year.;soybean

""There is going to be more rain for the next two, threedays,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal toabove normal moisture this week.""    Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southernMinnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in easternNebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.    Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend butwere receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.    Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio withthudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.    ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, apretty good rain,"" Mohler said.    Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparkingan early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board ofTrade.

FINNS AND CANADIANS TO STUDY MTBE PRODUCTION PLANT    HELSINKI, April 8 - Finland's national oil company Neste Oy<NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firmsto study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.    The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mlnCanadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether(MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.    The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese CanadaInc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe LineCompany Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.    The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materialsavailability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and theimportant capital and operating advantages gained by locatingon an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.    The partners would look into the feasibility of a plantproducing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancerthat can replace tetra ethyl lead.    Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United Stateswhere lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because ofhealth concerns, the statement added.    Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as theU.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination inCanada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,it said.    Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over fivebillion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has amajor investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.    The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go onstream in late 1989, the statement said.;gas

"JAPAN FIRMS TO LAUNCH SALES OF 100 OCTANE GASOLINE    TOKYO, June 19 -  Japanese oil companies are startingcampaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growingdomestic demand for higher quality motor fuel, oil sourcessaid.    Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline thissummer, starting with <Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.    Showa Shell Sekiyu KK <SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.    Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite ahigher price than regular octane gasoline, which has promptedother oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.    ""We have received a good response from consumers of FormulaShell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuelconsumption,"" Showa Shell said.    Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higherthan regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct shareof Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.    High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's totalgasoline sales in Japan, it added.    Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pctof its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediatelyafter the launch of its Idemitsu 100.    Nippon Oil Co Ltd <NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in highoctane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasolinesales.    The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market sharehas been spurred by expectations that the government will liftgasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline stationconstruction in the next two to three years.    ""Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasolinesales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasolineproduction quotas,"" an official at a major oil company said.    An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Tradeand Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the governmentpress ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, includingthe lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oilcompanies increase their international competitiveness.

While the consensus is for an increase, a few would notrule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said thatbarring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect thereport to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.    Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to besteady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oilprices, the analysts said.    Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming importscontinue at relatively high levels.    Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mlnbarrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.    Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, wholooks for a build said, ""We have had five weeks of gasolinedemand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off tobetween 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demandwould have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,"" he added.    Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a drawin stocks of about of about one mln barrels.       The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latestreport for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasolinedemand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.    But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely tofounder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.    Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and addto U.S. stocks.    But some analysts said that refiners may have held refineryruns.    Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel levelreported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks wasdiscounted as having a market impact at this time.    ""A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,""one futures analyst said.

"ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR    WELLINGTON, Oct 19 - An income tax surcharge and capitalgains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation ofthe N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.    Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and theBank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed torestore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut bycurrent government policies.    The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turnwould lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 couldbe much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.    Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as apercentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase wasprobably unavoidable, Bayliss said.    He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pctvalue-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationaryimpact of a currency depreciation.    The government had failed to bring inflation down despitelower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.    New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year toend-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.    The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflationpolicies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates andinsufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Baylisssaid. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debtand debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.    ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems aregoing to take much longer to solve than was originally thoughtis soundly based -- primarily because the government'smacro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,"" Bayliss said.";nzdlr
"NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE    WELLINGTON, June 18 - Analysts said they were surprised atthe government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus forfiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policystatements and positive for the economy.    Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplusfor the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrsagainst a 1.95 billion deficit last year.    Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surpluswas even more positive than the most bullish analysts'forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.    Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reutersbefore the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.    The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond andthe foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despitelower interest rates, as overseas investors became moreconfident about investing in New Zealand, he said.    However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, sayingthe local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and willmove lower.    The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in afterhours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budgetrelease.    Analysts said the budget was also positive for the sharemarket, despite an increase in the contribution of companytaxation to revenue figures.    One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplusannouncement could push the share market up by 50 pointstomorrow.    The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with acontinuation of existing policies, and the absence oftraditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positivelyby overseas investors, another said.    But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-taxavoidance measures could damage some sectors of the sharemarket, particularly multi-national companies.    The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. Therequirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mlnN.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.    Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable andthere appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, anothereconomist said. He added that the document seemed entirelycredible.    ""Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,""he said.    An election is due before the end of September.";nzdlr

"U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS<AUTHOR>    by Keith Leighty, Reuters</AUTHOR>    CHICAGO, April 9 - Commodities from gold to grains tocotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as lossesin the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears ofinflation and economic instability.    Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in NewYork, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs atroy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.    A key factor behind the advance was anticipation thatinflation will be the only way for the major industrial nationsto halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said SteveChronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,Harris Upham and Co., in New York.    The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials fromthe seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed theircommitment to support its value, and despite reports ofintervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.    Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, knownas the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-termdirection of the currency markets.    ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""Ifthey do, it's not evident.""    ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free markettake values to where they should be.    ""One way or another, we will force our major tradingpartners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correctthe mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.    ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a longtime, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It'sgoing to be a long and tedious process, but that's what'shappening,"" he said.    The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commoditiescheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.    At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bondssaw the value of their investments falling and many are turningto commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said MartyMcNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house ofDominick and Dominick.    The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughoutthe commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cottonposted broad gains.    Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in thegrain markets has shifted from concern about burdensomesupplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulateexport demand.    After the close of trading, the Agriculture Departmentraised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union bytwo mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.    Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on theChicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderatelyhigher.    Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They saidhogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal atthis time of year, and farmers have been too busy with fieldwork to market animals.";silver

"U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan</AUTHOR>    LONDON, Oct 20 - The United States is prepared to ""pull outall the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassadorto GATT Michael Samuels said.    Those rights are now being challenged by the EuropeanCommunity's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told aconference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.    He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate ifthe EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef withoutthe issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.    The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effecton January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meatshipments into the EC.    The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseedprices over the current market level and which may be extendedto include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.    Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral tradenegotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to beerected,"" Samuels said.    Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farmsubsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it isunrealistic.    The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposalon farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formallynext week.    The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reducetensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cerealssubstitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction offarm subsidies.    The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long asthey are directly linked to long-term commitments to end majortrade distortions, Samuels said.    Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formallysubmitted and respond to it officially then.    ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Estedeclaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""the U.S. Ambassador said.    The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignoresthe U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.    The key difference between the two approaches is that theU.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushingonly for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.    If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,there would be little incentive for the Community to work tocorrect the international trade situation, he added.    Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the ECoilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports tothird countries as three crucial barriers to trade which theU.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.";carcass

JAPAN 1986/87 COMPOUND FEED OUTPUT UP 2.3 PCT    TOKYO, June 18 - Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pctto 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln ayear earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.    The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand forpoultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beefcattle raising, Ministry officials said.    Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were217,554 tonnes against 224,101.    Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnesfrom 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.    The officials said corn imports rose because the worldsurplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reducedChicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.    Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices dueto poor harvests last year in major producing nations such asArgentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.    Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln andthe compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.    The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted fromincreased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.    Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against528,152 a year earlier.

"STUDY SAYS PORK LEANER THAN USDA FIGURES SHOW    Chicago, Oct 19 - An Iowa State University study showedpork contains considerably less fat than indicated bylong-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, theNational Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.    Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the studyaveraged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American HeartAssociation guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of allthe raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study containedless than six pct fat, the NPPC said.    Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as theestablished authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fatcontent for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.    Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairsfor the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancybetween the study and the USDA handbook.    ""Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on informationthat has been accumulated over the past 30 years. Thestatistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of todaywhich is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,""Kline said.    The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categoriesfrom 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat.

"LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS<AUTHOR>    By Greg McCune</AUTHOR>    Tokyo, April 17 - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngopens talks with Japanese government officials today well awarehis demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrusmarkets is likely to be rejected.     But in an interview with Reuters during the flight toTokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw aninternational spotlight on Japan's agricultural importprotection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to openits markets.    ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, butthey are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said.    U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessionsduring Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessionswould be unveiled later this month, they said.    ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (PrimeMinister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when hevisits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.    Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports bypartially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.    A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last weekrequesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial usessuch as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, sayingTokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.    Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota forbeef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers wouldlike to buy much more beef than currently allowed.    He cited the example of a California company whichtransports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter tocircumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher thanthe value of the animal, he said.    U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry PromotionCorporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrowfrom the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japanhas said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.    Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan toeliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice byApril, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventuallybe willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges becauseliberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanesemandarin orange industry.    The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate becauseimports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. AndJapanese officials have said.   Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buysurplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.   Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks inGeneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certainminor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.";carcass
"GATT CASE AGAINST JAPAN A MODEL FOR U.S. - LYNG    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyngsaid the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaintagainst Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance innegotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.    The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japanend quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by theend of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling willfavor the U.S.    ""These are quota items, and the principles that apply tothem, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question ofwhether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,"" Lyngtold Reuters in an interview.    He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas onbeef and citrus after March 31, next year.    The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the UnitedStates has challenged include items such as tomato paste, somecheeses and specialty fruit juices.    U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas wouldbe issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision hasbeen delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.    The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrusquotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protectJapanese farmers.    ""We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (onbeef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that anillegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.

"EC MEAT DIRECTIVE DEADLINE SEEN FLEXIBLE    WASHINGTON, April 13 - U.S. officials said they held outlittle hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw acontroversial meat inspection requirement, due to go intoeffect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cutoff their exports.    But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the yearprovided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.Agriculture Department.    The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive willrequire foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with ECinspection standards beginning April 30.    The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requestingthe Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.    At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mlndlrs in 1985.    The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changesin their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffingto use of wood.    Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approvedwithout further review. USDA would have to certify that theplants had corrected the deficiencies.    All remaining plants with a history or potential ofshipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require moresignificant changes in plant constructions or procedures beforefurther EC review.    Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American MeatInstitute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formaltrade retaliation petition by April 30.    An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draftpetition.

"EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - The European Community (EC) agreed atrade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the countryfollowing the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, ECofficials said.    Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentinawill gain additional trading rights on a series of productsincluding meat, fish and cereals by-products.    But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals withCanada and Japan and are due to study these again, theofficials said.    The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of ECstates after West Germany withdrew objections to increasedquotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.    Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,saying that the main dispute was over sales of cerealssubstitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, theofficials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit fromimproved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular thequota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef willbe increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.    Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reducedlevies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.    The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina saidthat Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected theirexports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. Theyhave been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade).    But officials said ministers had been unable to resolveCanadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain hadbeen affected by the country's EC membership.

Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. AgricultureDepartment's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defendedthe government's program, calling it ""one of the most respectedpublic health programs in the world.""    FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5billion chicken and turkeys every year.    Houston said inspection programs have kept pace withchange, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues inthe meat and poultry supply has increased.    He also said that, although he was confident the bacteriumsalmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take timeand much money to contain the growing problem.    Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, isfound in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of rawpork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.    The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.    ""We certainly really have not found an effective means ofturning this disease around,"" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)

"JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.<AUTHOR>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</AUTHOR>    TOKYO, April 8 - Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered byU.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, willtell U.S. Officials at talks later this month thatliberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,a senior ministry official said.    ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drivesby other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products andit is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberaliseits farm import market,"" he said.    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also openits wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated toprotect local farmers.    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheatexports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due tovisit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will askJapan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers andremove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Marketshare here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, hasbeen trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-yearbeef accord next March 31.    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased salesfrom China and South America, while Japanese soybean importsfrom Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, althoughthe U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up itsbeef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrainimports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December whenUnder Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan hasthe potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representingsome one billion dlrs in new business.    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese importcontrols on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan'stop business group Keidanren has urged the government to removeresidual import restrictions on agricultural products.    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotionalreaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issueshould not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in theindustrial sector.    ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and theseissues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the officialsaid.";carcass
"U.S. MEAT INDUSTRY LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN IN JAPAN    WASHINGTON, June 2 - The U.S. meat industry has launched anaggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumerawareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government torelax current beef import quotas.    U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrsannually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as highas six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas wereremoved and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of theattributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat ExportFederation said at a press conference today.    Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through theAgriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan waslaunched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April.    ""The promising Japanese beef market could be one of thebright spots for U.S. agricultural exports,"" said Philip Seng,Asian Director for the Federation. ""We supply and they (Japan)buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want tobuy more,"" he said.    Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limitstotal Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expandingU.S. beef shipments to Japan.    The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavyJapanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreementexpires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to getunderway this fall.    The Reagan administration has called for an end to thequotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said theywould not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure.    Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters thatthey do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but thatthey hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.    High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected markethas also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industryofficials said.    Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrsfor a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat associationsaid. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrsper pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb.    Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beefper year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,officials said.    Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and adecrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mlntonnes.";carcass
"DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY    HARARE, April 9 - Zimbabwe's beef exports to the EuropeanCommunity (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs thisyear, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouthdisease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.    The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to theEC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the ECveterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.    The outbreak in the country's main ranching province hasalready led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia tobar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairyindustry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in exportrevenue.    ""The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normallywhen an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension ofbeef exports,"" one industry source said yesterday.     Commenting on EC policy, he explained, ""Depending on theseriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee thendecides on three options, allowing us to continue exportingbeef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspensionon exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We arestill awaiting their decision,"" he added, asking not to beidentified.    Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes ofhigh-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country hadspent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences andupgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.    Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will beforced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at lowprices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef salescould fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.";carcass

COPA URGES TAX ON VEGETABLE PROTEINS    LUXEMBOURG, Oct 20 - The European Community's farmers'pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a taxon vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats taxwhich has already been proposed by the EC Commission.    Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference onTuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanismfor cereal substitutes.    He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with theDanish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chairmeetings of their EC colleagues.    Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would helpthe EC's budget problems and would provide some price stabilityfor producers.    This would in turn help the market position for certaincrops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peasand beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severeoutput restrictions.    A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats taxon imported and domestically produced oils and marine fatssucceeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual ECprice fixing.    However, the EC Commission has said it maintains itsproposals for a tax.    Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursueinternational negotiations on farm trade with the aim ofbridging the gap between EC and world prices.;veg-oil

"FRANCO-GERMAN PARLEY FAILS TO UNBLOCK FARM TALKS    BRUSSELS, June 29 - A specially convened Franco-Germanmeeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed tomake any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that hasdeeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said    The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreignministers from both countries and by French President FrancoisMitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by ChancellorHelmut Kohl of West Germany.    The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key toproviding a solution to a long-term settlement of theCommunity's worst-ever budget crisis.    ""The Germans clearly do not want to budge,"" an aide to Chiractold reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visiblyangered as he the hour-long meeting.

EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on thepackage, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadlinetomorrow.    Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could haveinjected fresh impetus into those talks.

"DUTCH CONSUMERS/INDUSTRY SEE VEG OILS TAX THREAT    THE HAGUE, June 18 - Dutch consumers and food processorswould be hit hard by the proposed EC tax on oils and fats, Dickde Bruyn, chairman of the commodity board for margarine, fatsand oils, MVO, said at the annual meeting.    The Dutch are the second largest consumers of margarine andfourth largest consumers of vegetable oils in the EC.    The fiercely contested tax would be a levy on consumers andsteeply increase the costs of industries such as potatoprocessing and cake and biscuit manufacturing, de Bruyn said.    ""A move by these industries to countries outside the ECcannot be ruled out,"" he added.    De Bruyn said the tax on vegetable and marine oils and fatswould be wide open to fraud, difficult to police, and hugelyexpensive administratively.

"ACP STATES SAY EC OILS TAX PLAN BREAKS ACCORDS    BRUSSELS, June 2 - Developing countries said the EuropeanCommunity (EC) would breach two international agreements if itwent ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.    Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific(ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit theexports of 26 ACP countries.    They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedureslaid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relationsbetween ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affecttrade between the two sides.    They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertakingnot to bring in new protectionist measures during the currentPunta del Este round of world trade negotiations being heldunder GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.    The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 Europeancurrency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-producedvegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which couldraise up to two billion Ecus a year.    EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at amarathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg onJune 15.    Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries areconvinced this would lead to EC industry substituting productsmade within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimatesthis would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in itsmember country exports.    ""We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures toundermine our countries, but such would be the impact of thesemeasures,"" Wilson said.    The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hitby the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if itis approved.    Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only ""as a verylast resort,"" but added that the ACP is in touch with othercountries which oppose the plan.

GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE    ANTWERP, June 18 - The rate of increase in world palm oiluse is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that inthe next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year averageincrease of 550,000 tonnes.     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expectedto be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlierlevels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnesabove this season's available amount, Mielke said.    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia willslow down from this year on, but that will be offset by areaexpansion in Indonesia, he said.    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesianmature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, andat 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,but where yields are lower, he said.     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is alsoexpected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel andpalm.    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils wereunusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the currentseason's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year agoand with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the startof next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks bythe end of next season.    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks lastOctober and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 atthe end of next season, Mielke said.    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in thecourse of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen insoybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mlntonnes or by one fifth.    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mlntonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocksof 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of thisseason.;veg-oil
"ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT        LONDON, Oct 20 - The American Soybean Association (ASA)denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegalunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, andthreatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does notremedy the situation.    ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsoredOutlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takesdrastic and immediate steps.""    ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,since they were established after the zero soybean duty wasestablished in 1962,"" he said.    The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would askfor an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies tomake the regime non-discriminatory.    The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, inan effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds productionhas risen dramatically since then.    The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above worldmarket levels and is considering implementing a controversialoils and fats tax.

"PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX<AUTHOR>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</AUTHOR>    MANILA, June 1 - Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later thismonth to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community(EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.    ""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is puttingup this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countrieslike the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview.    He said he did not know how much support the levy hadwithin the EC but he said he believed those originally opposedto the tax were under pressure to change their position.    Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, theNetherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. Butthere was a danger some of them would be persuaded to changesides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.    Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warningthat copra meal cake used in livestock feeds containeddangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.    He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin permillion parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked toapply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copracake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.    Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when itis not properly dried or ground.    Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal inLondon that the Philippines was doing its best to meet ECstandards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,but this was likely to take several years of research.    Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of totalcoconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.    Romero said he would also visit Oxford University'sdepartment of agricultural economics to discuss ways ofavoiding the copra process altogether.    ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside ofcopra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without dryingthe meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can processcoconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go tothe chemical root.""    He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries tobecome more protectionist and he expected export prices ofcoconut products to drop.    ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for moreand more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" hesaid.    With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping upproduction of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oiloutput had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.    ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spendingbillions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil bysaying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""he said.    Romero said he expected coconut product export prices tostay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch ahigh of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.    Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-yearcoconut production cycle which showed production tended to fallafter two successive years of good harvests.    He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, toadd to the production fall, drought had affected output.    ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought theprices will start declining again. The only sure way to keepprices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said.    Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop byplanting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.    ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romerosaid. He said the government's proposed land reform programwould exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because theyhad less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.    ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said.    PCA figures show about one-third of the country'spopulation is dependent on the coconut industry.    Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares orone-fourth of total agricultural land.";veg-oil

"LYNG PLEASED EC TO OFFER GATT FARM PROPOSAL    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - U.S. Agriculture Secretary RichardLyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer aglobal farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although theUnited States opposes key parts of the proposal.    ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyngtold Reuters in an interview Tuesday.    Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourgendorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguayround agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.    Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the planseeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposingcurbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.    The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of allfarm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and haspressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reachinga global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.    However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said theReagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies isunrealistic.    Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative todoing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. Ithink that is the unrealistic position.""    ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we aretrying to say.""    Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree afreeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started.    ""All that some countries would like to have would be awheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.    The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range ofagricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, hesaid.    At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada isexpected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.

INDONESIA SEES CPO PRICE RISING SHARPLY    JAKARTA, April 8 - Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO)prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOBsometime this year because of better European demand and a fallin Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for treecrops, told Indonesian reporters.    Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.    Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despitemaking recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that itcould possibly increase its international market share.    Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oilafter Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensuresupplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.    Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporaryshortage than to lose export markets.

"EC FARM MINISTERS TO MEET TOMORROW AFTER SUMMIT    BRUSSELS, June 29 - European Community agricultureministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of atwo-day summit meeting of heads of government, to again attemptto agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commissionspokesman said.    He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will containnotice of special agricultural measures of a purely technicalnature which will come into effect on July 1 unless theministers reach an accord.    The spokesman declined to detail these special measures butsaid they would not be the sort of ""dynamic"" moves which EC FarmCommissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in thecase of complete deadlock among farm ministers.    These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting ofministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord, ECsources said.    Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals pricesby seven pct and to take other drastic action, trade sourcessaid.    EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 stillsplit over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable andmarine oils and fats.    In addition, West Germany said it would veto plans forcereal price cuts and for a change in the green currencysystem.    Earlier today, diplomats said Belgium, the current holderof the European Community presidency, appears ready to drop theplans for the controversial oils and fats tax.";veg-oil
MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET    KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 - Malaysia is unlikely to meet itstargeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.    Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliserand overstressed palms, they said.    The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil Worldnewsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely todrop sharply this year.    Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell morepalm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage theindustry, a leading grower told Reuters.    The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnesagainst about 800,000 last March, the growers said.    The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this yeardue to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.    The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.    In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expectedto enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oiloutput peaks.    They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new treesagainst 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reductionwill not be felt for about another three years.;veg-oil
USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT     WASHINGTON, April 9 - U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mlntonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the priorweek, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.Agriculture Department said.    In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, thedepartment said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largestbuyers.    Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.    Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season andnet reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season werefour-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and thefour-week average, it said.    Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination withpurchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.    Other significant purchasers for the current year wereMexico and Honduras, it said.    Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below theprior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.    Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the majorpurchasers, the department said.    Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-weekaverage. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, theNetherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset byreductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.    Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, theDepartment said.    Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's levelbut nine pct below the four-week average.    Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followedby Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.    Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than theprior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers. ;veg-oil
"US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT    WASHINGTON, Oct 19 - A proposal to require importedtropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrowand possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.    The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopesthe plan would be adopted this year.    A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as anamendment to a farm spending reduction package.    ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as givingAmerican consumers the information they need,"" he said.    Proponents of the measure, including the American SoybeanAssociation, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oilsare high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.    The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicatingtropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourageconsumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,Indonesia and the Philippines.    But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible todefend under international trade law and would harm relationswith the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.    Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of theirsaturated fats from meat and dairy products and relativelylittle from tropical oils.    The committee voted largely along party lines, with threeDemocrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.";veg-oil
"EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX    ****ANTWERP, June 18 - A spokesman for the EuropeanCommunity Commission defended the controversial plan for a levyon oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to helpalleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.    Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission'sDirectorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oilsand Fats Contact Days ""the Commission firmly believes that thesacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers inthe oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers tomake an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problemwithin that sector by paying a levy.""    The proposed tax is necessary because the level ofbudgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseedsproduction has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.    Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion EuropeanCurrency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's ""standstill""agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would thenfeel the full impact of its enlargement.    The Commission has proposed several cost and productioncutting measures which include the introduction of a maximumguaranteed quantity system, he added.    Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumerprices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghesaid.    Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatoryamount when market prices are below or above this level.    He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatoryamount would be used to finance the Common AgriculturalPolicy's oils and fats regime.    ""The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to theproposed tax) have for the most part been based on incompleteor an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,"" he said.    Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.    It would not be discriminatory because it would be appliedto domestic and imported products, and past experience showedit would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.    EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they dounder present aid arrangements, he said.    The competitiveness between different oils, whether ECproduced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantitiesimported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,Tanghe said.    The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overalleffect would stabilise Community production levels withoutaffecting demand, he said.    It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain currentimport levels, he said.    Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they areimported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and mealsrequirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from importedbeans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.";veg-oil

"MALAYSIA TO RESEARCH TIN, WARY ON VEG OILS TAX<AUTHOR>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</AUTHOR>    BRUSSELS, June 19 - Malaysia is to urge fellow tinproducing countries to contribute more money towards researchinto new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industriesminister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview.    Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said hehad instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executivecommittee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC,to draw up a paper on the matter.    Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner FransAndriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.    He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposalsfor a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would bedefeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.    Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax wasadopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,they would be compensated through access to the EC foralternative exports.    ""Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannotsee how this would work out in our case,"" Lim said.    Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250mln dlrs a year.    The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPCmeeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.    ""Not enough research and development effort has been put inby tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutessuch as aluminium, paper and plastics,"" Lim said.    He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as anexciting possible new application.    Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra moneywhich needed to be spent on research into new uses before thenew paper was produced.    He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamentalbarriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new InternationalRubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accordinto some EC languages are still being awaited.    Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia'sbehalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said itwas important there should not be a long ""interregnum"" betweenthe old agreement lapsing in October and the new one cominginto force.    He described the present accord as a model for commodityagreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing andconsuming countries and by virtue of its review systems andcontrol over buffer stock management.";veg-oil
"INDIAN RESERVE BANK TIGHTENS CREDIT POLICY    BOMBAY, Oct 19 - The Reserve Bank of India said it wastightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raisingtheir cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective fromOctober 24.    The move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank'spolicy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March andis aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity.    The central bank also put selective controls on bankadvances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades.    ""The policy's main objective is to fully meet the creditrequirements of agriculture, industry and exports, whilepreventing excessive monetary expansion,"" bank Governor R.N.Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks.    Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be keptunder control in the second half of the current financial year.    Bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first sixmonths of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the sameperiod last year, according to the bank.    Bankers said the bank's move to raise the cash reserveratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupeesfrom the banking system. Banks' total deposits are estimated ataround 1,000 billion rupees.    They said banks are under pressure because of low returnson commercial lending and investments in government securities.    ""Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintaintheir statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and areresorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings,"" said one banker.";veg-oil
"INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND<AUTHOR>    By Jeremy Clift, Reuters</AUTHOR>    JAKARTA, April 8 - The Indonesian Commodity Exchange islikely to start trading in at least one new commodity, andpossibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman PaianNainggolan said.    He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading inpalm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.    Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oilmay also be introduced. But he said the question was stillbeing considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and nodecision on when to go ahead had been made.    The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubberphysicals on an open outcry system four days a week.    ""Several factors make us move cautiously,"" Nainggolan said.""We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make amistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.""    Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffeeadded in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up tofive months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five aretraded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,exchange officials said.    The trade ministry and exchange board are considering theintroduction of futures trading later for rubber, but oneofficial said a feasibility study was needed first. Nodecisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April23, traders said.    Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as theworld's second largest producer of natural rubber, shouldexpand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development ofthe exchange would help this.    Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boostoverseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.    He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan toencourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation wouldalso visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states toencourage participation.    Officials say the infant exchange has made a good startalthough trading in coffee has been disappointing.    Transactions in rubber between the start of trading inApril 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber deliveredlocally, the latest exchange report said.     Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.     Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and44 traders.";veg-oil
"EC PRESIDENCY PREPARED TO DROP OILS AND FATS TAX    BRUSSELS, June 29 - Belgium, current holder of the EuropeanCommunity presidency, appears ready to drop a controversialoils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm pricepackage, diplomats said.    In a discussion document prepared for today's summitmeeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called""stabilising mechanism"" be the subject of ""further study andconsultation with the Community's main trading partners.""    The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne onboth imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marineoils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.    The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row atthe summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm pricetalks, contained the first formal reference to dropping themeasure.    Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency onJune 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They aresupported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesserextent, Spain.

He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by thecabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week.    The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, hesaid. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes.    Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from theU.S. And the rest from South America.
